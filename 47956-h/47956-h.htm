<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-i.jpg" width="121" height="118" alt="I" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capi">IT would not be consistent with the proposed
character of this work to enlarge on the
Christian dispensation, as connected with the
sacred feast of Christmas; to show Christianity
as old as the Creation; that the fall of man naturally involved
his punishment; and hence the vicarious sacrifice of our
Saviour to redeem us from sin and death. These are subjects
to be entered on by those who have had opportunities,
if not of thinking more, at least of reading more, relative to
them, than the writer of these pages, whose leisure hours are
few, and whose endeavour will be to give, in as popular and
interesting a manner as his abilities will enable him, some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
information respecting the mode of keeping this Holy Feast,
particularly in England, in the olden times, and in the middle
ages.</p>

<p>The Nativity is hailed by Christians of all denominations,
as the dawn of our salvation; the harbinger of the day-spring
on high; that promise of futurity, where care, sin, and sorrow
enter not, where friends long severed shall meet to part no
more; no pride, no jealousy, no self (that besetting sin of the
world) intruding. Well, then, may we observe it with gratitude
for the unbounded mercy vouchsafed to us; for the fulfilment
of the promise pronounced in the beginning of the world,
releasing us from the dominion of Satan. A promise which
even the Pagans did not lose sight of, although they confused
its import, as a glimmering of it may be traced through their
corrupted traditions and superstitious ceremonies.</p>

<p>Has the early dream of youth faded away purposeless?—the
ambition of manhood proved vanity of vanities? Have riches
made themselves wings and flown away? or, has fame, just
within the grasp, burst like a bubble? Have the friends, the
companions of youth, one by one fallen off from thy converse;
or the prop of advancing age been removed, leaving thee
weak and struggling with the cares of life; or, has “the
desire of thine eyes” been taken from thee at a stroke?
Under these and other trials, the Christian looks to the
anniversary of the Nativity (that rainbow of Christianity)
as the commemoration of the birth of the Blessed Redeemer,
who will give rest to the weary, and receive in his eternal
kingdom all those who truly trust in him. And well may His
name be called, “Wonderful, Counsellor, the Mighty God,
the Everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace!”</p>

<p>The season of Christmas, however, was not only set apart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
for sacred observance, but soon became a season of feasting
and revelry; so much so, that even our sumptuary laws have
recognised it, and exempted it from their operation. When
Edward the Third, in his tenth year, endeavoured to restrain
his subjects from over luxury in their meals, stating that the
middle classes sought to imitate the great in this respect, and
thus impoverished themselves, and became the less able to
assist their liege lord, he forbade more than two courses, and
two sorts of meat in each, to any person, except in the great
feasts of the year, namely, “La veile et le jour de Noël, le
jour de Saint Estiephne, le jour del an renoef (New Year’s
Day), les jours de la Tiphaynei et de la Purification de Nostre
Dame,” &amp;c.</p>

<p>A cheerful and hospitable observance of this festival being
quite consistent with the reverence due to it, let us—after
having as our first duty repaired to the house of our Lord,
to return humble thanks for the inestimable benefits now
conferred—while preparing to enter into our own enjoyments,
enable, as far as in our power, our dependants and poorer
brethren, to participate in the earthly comforts, as they do in
the heavenly blessings of the season. Remember the days of
darkness will come, and who can say how soon, how suddenly?
and if long and late to some, yet will they surely come,
when the daughters of music are laid low, then the remembrance
of a kindly act of charity to our neighbour will soothe
the careworn brow, and smooth the restless pillow of disease.
“Go,” then, “your way; eat the fat and drink the sweet,
and send portions unto them for whom nothing is prepared:
for this day is holy unto our Lord.”</p>

<p>A great similarity exists in the observances of the return of
the seasons, and of other general festivals throughout the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
world; and indeed the rites and ceremonies of the various
pagan religions have, to a great extent, the marks of a common
origin; and the study of popular antiquities involves
researches into the early history of mankind, and their religious
ceremonies.</p>

<p>Immediately after the deluge, the religion of Noah and
his family was pure; but a century had scarcely elapsed before
it became perverted among some of his descendants. That
stupendous pagan temple, the Tower of Babel, was built, and
the confusion of tongues, and dispersion of mankind, followed.
As the waves of population receded farther from the centre,
the systems of religion—except with the chosen people—got
more and more debased, and mingled with allegories and
symbols. But still, even the most corrupt preserved many
allusions to the fall of man, and his redemption; to the
deluge, and the deliverance by the ark; and to a future state.
Thus, whether in China, Egypt, India, Africa, Scandinavia,
in the rites of Vitzliputzli in Mexico, and of Pacha Camac, in
Peru, among the Magi, the Brahmins, the Chaldæans, the
Gymnosophists, and the Druids, the same leading features
may be traced. It has even been supposed, that amongst a
chosen race of the priests, some traditionary knowledge of the
true religion prevailed, which they kept carefully concealed
from the uninitiated.</p>

<p>One of the greatest festivals was that in celebration of the
return of the sun; which, at the winter solstice, began gradually
to regain power, the year commenced anew, and the
season was hailed with rejoicings and thanksgivings. The
Saxons, and other northern nations, kept a feast on the 25th
of December, in honour of Thor, and called it the <i>Mother-Night</i>,
as the parent of other nights; also <i>Mid-Winter</i>. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
was likewise called <i>Gule</i>, <i>Gwyl</i>, <i>Yule</i>, or <i>Iul</i>, and half a dozen
similar names, respecting the meaning of which learned antiquaries
differ: Gebelin and others stating they convey the
idea of revolution or wheel; while others, equally learned,
consider the meaning to be festival, or holy-day. <i>Gwyl</i> in
Welsh, and <i>Geol</i> in Saxon, both signify a holy-day; and
as <i>Yule</i>, or <i>I-ol</i>, also signifies ale, an indispensable accompaniment
of Saxon and British feasts, they were probably
convertible terms. The word <i>Yule</i> may be found in many
of our ancient metrical romances, and some of the old
mysteries, as applied to Christmas, and is still so used in
Scotland, and parts of England. The word <i>Gala</i> would seem
to have a similar derivation. The curious in these matters
may, however, refer to the learned Hickes’s two folios,
Gebelin’s nine quartos, and Du Cange’s ten folios, and other
smaller works, and satisfy their cravings after knowledge.</p>

<p>The feast of the birth of Mithras was held by the Romans
on the 25th of December, in commemoration of the return of
the sun; but the most important heathen festival, at this
period of the year, was the <i>Saturnalia</i>, a word which has
since become proverbial for high-jinks, and all manner of
wild revelry. The origin seems to be unknown, but to have
been previous to the foundation of Rome, and to have had
some reference to the happy state of freedom and equality
in the golden age of Saturn, whenever that era of dreams
existed; for, when we go back to the olden times, no matter
how far, we find the archæologists of that age still looking
back on their older times: and so we are handed back, not
knowing where to stop, until we stumble against the Tower
of Babel, or are stopped by the prow of the Ark, and then
decline going any farther.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>The Greeks, Mexicans, Persians, and other great nations of
antiquity, including of course the Chinese, who always surpassed
any other country, had similar festivals. During the
Saturnalia among the Romans, which lasted for about a week
from the 17th of December, not only were masters and slaves
on an equality, but the former had to attend on the latter,
who were allowed to ridicule them. Towards the end of the
feast a king or ruler was chosen, who was invested with
considerable powers, and may be supposed to be intimately
connected with our Lord of Misrule, or Twelfth Night King,—presents
also were mutually given, and public places decked
with shrubs and flowers. The birth of our Saviour thus took
place at that time of the year, already marked by some of the
most distinguished feasts. And why should it not have been
so? We know that, at whatever period of the year it took
place, it would have been, for Christians, “The Feast of
Feasts;” and it is surely no derogation to imagine, that it
was appointed at this time as the fulfilment of all feasts, and
the culmination of festivals. The rising of the Christian Sun
absorbed in its rays the lesser lights of early traditions, and
it has continued to illuminate us with its blended brilliancy.
Abercrombie, in his work on the Intellectual Powers, has
some able remarks on the value of an unbroken series of
traditional testimony or rites, especially as applicable to
Christianity. “If the events, particularly, are of a very
uncommon character, these rites remove any feeling of uncertainty
which attaches to traditional testimony, when it has
been transmitted through a long period of time, and, consequently,
through a great number of individuals. They carry
us back, in one unbroken series, to the period of the events
themselves, and to the individuals who were witnesses of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
them. The most important application of the principle, in
the manner now referred to, is in those observances of
religion which are intended to commemorate the events
connected with the revelation of the Christian faith. The
importance of this mode of transmission has not been
sufficiently attended to by those who have urged the insufficiency
of human testimony, to establish the course of events
which are at variance with the common course of nature.”</p>

<p>During the Commonwealth, some of the Puritan party
endeavoured to show that the 25th of December was not
really the Birth of our Saviour, but that it took place at a
different time of the year. Thomas Mockett, in ‘Christmas,
the Christian’s Grand Feast,’ has collected the principal
statements corroborative of this view—arguments they cannot
be called; and after all, his conclusion is nothing more than,
be the 25th of December the right day or not, Christians
were not bound to keep it as a feast, because the supreme
authority of the land, and ordinances of both Houses of Parliament,
had directed otherwise. Parliament, however, cannot
control the day of the Nativity, though it can do a great
deal; having, on one occasion, according to tradition, nearly
passed an act against the growth of poetry (an enactment
perhaps not much wanted at present), though this was said
to have been a clerical error; and, at another time, after
inflicting a punishment of fourteen years’ transportation, gave
half to the king and half to the informer; this, as may be
supposed, was subsequently repealed. If, however, it is safe
to say anything against Parliament, even of two hundred
years since, without fear of the pains and penalties of contempt,
it might be presumed that, like the patient in the
‘Diary of a Physician,’ they had “turned heads.” Dr. Thomas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
Warmstry, in ‘The Vindication of the Solemnity of the
Nativity of Christ,’ published three years previous to Mockett’s
tract, gives satisfactory replies to the objections made by
the Puritans, and seems to have embodied the arguments
against them, considering it sufficient for us that the Church
has appointed the 25th of December for our great feast.</p>

<p>Whether the Apostles celebrated this day, although probable,
is not capable of proof; but Clemens Romanus, about
the year 70, when some of them were still living, directs the
Nativity to be observed on the 25th of December. From his
time to that of Bernard, the last of the Fathers, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1120,
the feast is mentioned in an unbroken series; a tract, called
‘Festorum Metropolis,’ 1652, naming thirty-nine Fathers,
who have referred to it, including Ignatius, Cyprian, Athanasius,
Gregory Nazianzen, Ambrosius, Chrysostom, Augustine,
and Bede; besides historians and more modern divines.
‘The Feast of Feasts,’ 1644, also contains many particulars
of the celebration during the earlier centuries of Christianity.
About the middle of the fourth century, the feasting was
carried to excess, as may have been the case occasionally in
later times; and Gregory Nazianzen wars against such feasting,
and dancing, and crowning the doors, so that the temporal
rejoicing seems to have taken the place of the spiritual
thanksgiving. In the same age there occurred one of those
acts of brutality, which throughout all ages have disgraced
humanity. The Christians having assembled in the Temple
at Nicomedia, in Bithynia, to celebrate the Nativity,
Dioclesian, the tyrant, had it inclosed, and set on fire, when
about 20,000 persons are said to have perished; the number,
however, appears large.</p>

<p>The early Christians, of the eastern and western Churches,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
slightly differed in the day on which they celebrated this
feast: the Easterns keeping it, together with the Baptism,
on the 6th of January, calling it the Epiphany; while the
Westerns, from the first, kept it on the 25th of December;
but in the fourth century the Easterns changed their festival
of the Nativity to the same day, thus agreeing with the
Westerns. The Christian epoch was, it is said, first introduced
into chronology about the year 523, and was first
established in this country by Bede. New Year’s Day was
not observed by the early Christians as the Feast of the
Circumcision, but (excepting by some more zealous persons,
who kept it as a fast) with feasting, songs, dances, interchange
of presents, &amp;c., in honour of the new year; though the bishops
and elders tried to check these proceedings, which were probably
founded in some measure on the Roman feast of the
double-faced Janus, held by them on this day. According to
Brady, the first mention of it, as a Christian festival, was in
487; and it is only to be traced from the end of the eleventh
century, under the title of the Circumcision; and was not
generally so kept until included in our liturgy, in 1550;
although, from early times, Christmas Day, the Nativity, and
Twelfth Day, were the three great days of Christmas-tide.
Referring to the probability, that the feasting on New Year’s
Day might have been derived from the feast of Janus, it must
be observed, that some of the early Christians, finding the
heathens strongly attached to their ancient rites and customs,
which made it difficult to abolish them (at least until
after a considerable lapse of time), took advantage of this
feeling, and engrafted the Christian feasts on those of the
heathen, first modifying and purifying them. The practice
may have been wrong, but the fact was so. Thus, Gregory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
Thaumaturgus, bishop of Neocæsarea, who died in 265, instituted
festivals in honour of certain Saints and Martyrs, in
substitution of those of the heathens, and directed Christmas
to be kept with joy and feasting, and sports, to replace
the <i>Bacchanalia</i> and <i>Saturnalia</i>. Pagan temples were converted
into Christian churches; the statues of the heathen
deities were converted into Christian saints; and papal Rome
preserved, under other names, many relics of heathen Rome.
The Pantheon was converted into a Romish church, and
Jupiter changed to St. Peter.</p>

<p>When Pope Gregory sent over St. Augustin to convert
Saxon England, he directed him to accommodate the ceremonies
of the Christian worship as much as possible to those
of the heathen, that the people might not be too much
startled at the change; and, in particular, he advised him to
allow the Christian converts, on certain festivals, to kill and
eat a great number of oxen, to the glory of God, as they had
formerly done to the honour of the devil. St. Augustin, it
appears, baptized no fewer than 10,000 persons on the Christmas
day next after his landing in 596, and permitted, in
pursuance of his instructions, the usual feasting of the inhabitants,
allowing them to erect booths for their own refreshment,
instead of sacrificing to their idols,—objecting only to
their joining in their dances with their pagan neighbours.
Thus several of the pagan observances became incorporated
with the early Christian festivals; and to such an extent,
that frequent endeavours were made, by different Councils, to
suppress or modify them; as, in 589, the songs and dances,
at the festivals of Saints, were prohibited by the Council of
Toledo, and by that of Chalon, on the Saone, in 650. In
after times, the clergy still found it frequently requisite to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
connect the remnants of pagan idolatry with Christianity, in
consequence of the difficulty they found in suppressing it.
So, likewise, on the introduction of the Protestant religion,
some of the Roman Catholic ceremonies, in a modified state,
were preserved; and thus were continued some of the pagan
observances. In this manner may many superstitious customs,
still remaining at our great feasts, and in our games
and amusements, be accounted for.</p>

<p>The practice of decorating churches and houses with evergreens,
branches, and flowers, is of very early date. The
Jews used them at their Feast of Tabernacles, and the
heathens in several of their ceremonies, and they were
adopted by the Christians. Our Saviour Himself permitted
branches to be used as a token of rejoicing, upon His
triumphal entry to Jerusalem. It was natural, therefore,
that at Christmas time, when His Birth, and the fulfilment
of the promise to fallen man, were celebrated, that this
symbol of rejoicing should be resorted to. Some of the early
Councils, however, considering the practice somewhat savoured
of paganism, endeavoured to abolish it; and, in 610, it was
enacted, that it was not lawful to begirt or adorn houses with
laurel, or green boughs, for all this practice savours of paganism.
In the earlier carols the holly and the ivy are mentioned,
where the ivy, however, is generally treated as a foil to
the holly, and not considered appropriate to festive purposes.</p>

<p>
“Holly and Ivy made a great party,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Who should have the mastery</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">In lands where they go.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Then spake Holly, I am friske and jolly,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I will have the mastery</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">In lands where they go.”</span><br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>But in after times it was one of the plants in regular use.
Stowe mentions holme, ivy, and bays, and gives an account of
a great storm on Candlemas Day, 1444, which rooted up a
standard tree, in Cornhill, nailed full of holme and ivy for
Christmas, an accident that by some was attributed to the
evil spirit. Old Tusser’s direction is “Get ivye and hull
(holly) woman deck up thine house.” The misletoe—how
could Shakespeare call it the “baleful misletoe?”—was an
object of veneration among our pagan ancestors in very early
times, and as it is probable it was the golden branch referred
to by Virgil, in his description of the descent to the lower
regions, it may be assumed to have been used in the religious
ceremonies of the Greeks and Romans. His branch appears
to have been the misletoe of the oak, now of great rarity,
though it is found on many other trees. It was held sacred
by the Druids and Celtic nations, who attribute to it valuable
medicinal qualities, calling it <i>allheal</i> and <i>guidhel</i>, and they
preferred, if not selected exclusively, the misletoe of the oak.
Vallancey says it was held sacred because the berries as well
as the leaves grow in clusters of three united to one stalk,
and they had a veneration for the number three; his observation,
however, is incorrect as to the leaves, which are in
pairs only. The Gothic nations also attached extraordinary
qualities to it, and it was the cause of the death of their deity
Balder. For Friga, when she adjured all the other plants,
and the animals, birds, metals, earth, fire, water, reptiles,
diseases, and poison, not to do him any hurt, unfortunately
neglected to exact any pledge from the misletoe, considering
it too weak and feeble to hurt him, and despising it perhaps
because it had no establishment of its own, but lived upon
other plants. When the gods, then, in their great assembly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
amused themselves by throwing darts and other missiles at
him, which all fell harmless, Loke, moved with envy, joined
them in the shape of an old woman, and persuaded Hoder,
who was blind, to throw a branch of misletoe, and guided his
hand for the purpose; when Balder, being pierced through by
it, fell dead. The Druids celebrated a grand festival on the
annual cutting of the misletoe, which was held on the sixth
day of the moon nearest their new year. Many ceremonies
were observed, the officiating Druid being clad in white, with
a golden sickle, and received the plant in a white cloth.
These ceremonies kept alive the superstitious feelings of the
people, to whom no doubt the Druids were in the habit of
dispensing the plant at a high price; and as late as the
seventeenth century, peculiar efficacy was attached to it, and
a piece hung round the neck was considered as a safeguard
against witches. In modern times it has a tendency to lead
us towards witches of a more attractive nature; for, as is well
known, if one can by favour or cunning induce a fair one to
come under the misletoe he is entitled to a salute, at the
same time he should wish her a happy new year, and present
her with one of the berries for good luck; each bough,
therefore, is only laden with a limited number of kisses,
which should be well considered in selecting one. In some
places people try lots by the crackling of the leaves and
berries in the fire.</p>

<p>From the pagan Saturnalia and Lupercalia probably were
derived those extraordinary but gross, and as we should now
consider them, profane observances, the Feast of Asses and the
Feast of Fools, with other similar burlesque festivals. In the
early ages of Christianity, there were practices at the beginning
of the year of men going about dressed in female attire or in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
skins of beasts, causing occasionally much vice and debauchery;
but the regular Feast of Asses and Feast of Fools
were not apparently fully established until the ninth or tenth
century; a period when it was considered a sufficient qualification
for a priest, if he could read the Gospels and understand
the Lord’s Prayer. All sorts of buffooneries and
abominations were permitted at these representations; mock
anthems and services were sung; an ass, covered with rich
priestly robes, was gravely conducted to the choir, and provided
from time to time with drink and provender, the
inferior clergy, choristers, and people dancing round him
and imitating his braying; while all sorts of impurities
were committed, even at the holy altar. A hymn was sung,
commencing—</p>

<p>
Orientis partibus<br />
Adventavit asinus;<br />
Pulcher et fortissimus,<br />
Sarcinis aptissimus.<br />
Hez, Sire Asnes, car chantez;<br />
Belle bouche rechignez;<br />
Vous aurez du foin assez.<br />
Et de l’avoine à planter.<br />
Lentus erat pedibus,<br />
Nisi foret baculus,<br />
Et cum in clunibus<br />
Pungeret aeuleus.<br />
</p>

<p>and after several verses in this strain, finishing with—</p>

<p>
Hez va! hez va! hez va, hez!<br />
Bialx Sire Asnes car allez;<br />
Belle bouche car chantez.<br />
</p>

<p>On the mock mass being completed, the officiating priest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
turned to the people and said, “Ite missa est,” and brayed
three times, to which they responded by crying or braying
out, Hinham, Hinham, Hinham. This festival is said to
have been in commemoration of the flight to Egypt; but
there was one kept at Rouen in honour of Balaam’s ass,
where the performers, if they may be so called, walked in
procession on Christmas Day, representing the prophets
and others, as David, Moses, Balaam, Virgil, &amp;c., just as
General Wolfe may now be seen as a party in the Christmas
play of St. George and the Dragon. Many attempts were
made from the twelfth to the end of the sixteenth century
to suppress these licentious abuses of sacred things; and
although by that time they were abolished in the churches,
yet they were continued by the laity, and our modern mummers
probably have their origin from them. A pupil of
Gassandi, writing to him as late as 1645, mentions having
seen in the church at Aix, the Feast of Innocents (which
was of a similar nature) kept by the lay brethren and
servants in the church, dressed in ragged sacerdotal ornaments,
with books reversed, having large spectacles, with
rinds of scooped oranges instead of glasses. Louis the
Twelfth, in the early part of the sixteenth century, ordered
the representation of the gambol of the ‘Prince des Sots’ and
the ‘Mère sotte,’ in which, according to a note to Rabelais,
liv. i, c. 2, ed. 1823, Julius the Second and the Court of
Rome were represented. This was about the time probably
when the principality of Chauny wishing to have some
swans (<i>cignes</i>) for the waters ornamenting their town, unluckily
wrote to Paris for some <i>cinges</i> (singe being then
written with a <i>c</i>), and in due time received a wagonful
of apes. They could, therefore, have readily proffered their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
scribe as the prince des sots, excepting that it takes a wise
man to make a good fool. At Angers, there was an old
custom called Aquilanneuf, or Guilanleu, where young persons
went round to churches and houses on the first of the
year, to collect contributions, nominally to purchase wax in
honour of the Virgin, or the patron of the church, crying
out, <i>Au gui menez Rollet Follet, tiri liri mainte du blanc et
point du bis</i>; they had a chief called <i>Roi Follet</i>, and spent
their money in feasting and debauchery. An order was
made by the synod there, in 1595, which stopped the practice
in the churches, but another, in 1668, was necessary
to modify and restrain it altogether.</p>

<p>Feasts of this description were not much in vogue in
England, though they were introduced, as we find them prohibited
at Lincoln, by Bishop Grosthead, in the time of
Henry the Third; but towards the end of the following century
they were probably abolished. There are traces of the
fool’s dance, where the dancers were clad in fool’s habits, in
the reign of Edward the Third. A full account of these
strange observances may be found in Ducange, and in Du
Tilliot’s Mémoires de la Fête des Foux.</p>

<p>Christianity was introduced among the Britons at a very
early period, but there are no records, that can be considered
authentic, of their mode of keeping the feast of the Nativity,
though it was doubtless observed as one of their highest
festivals. Some of the druidical ceremonies might have
been embodied, and even the use of the mysterious misletoe
then adopted, the aid of the bards called in, and ale
and mead quaffed in abundance. The great and veritable
King Arthur, according to the ballad of the “Marriage of
Sir Gawaine,”—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>
“......a royale Christmasse kept,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">With mirth and princelye cheare;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">To him repaired many a knighte,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">That came both farre and neare.”</span><br />
</p>

<p>This, though ancient, is certainly of a date long subsequent
to the far-famed hero; but it ought to be taken as authority,
for, according to the modern progress of antiquarianism, the
farther off we live from any given time or history, the more
we know about it; the old Babylonians, Greeks, Romans,
and Mediævals, knowing nothing respecting themselves and
their next door neighbours, while we are as familiar as if we
had been born and bred with them. By the same rule
of remoteness, the modern chronicler, Whistlecraft (Frere),
should be taken as authority, for the particulars of the
ancient Christmas feast, on which he humorously thus
dilates:—</p>

<p>
“They served up salmon, venison, and wild boars,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">By hundreds, and by dozens, and by scores,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Hogsheads of honey, kilderkins of mustard,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Muttons, and fatted beeves, and bacon swine,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Herons and bitterns, peacocks, swan, and bustard,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Teal, mallard, pigeons, widgeons, and, in fine,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Plum-puddings, pancakes, apple-pies, and custard,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And therewithal they drank good Gascon wine,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">With mead, and ale, and cider of our own,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">For porter, punch, and negus were not known.”</span><br />
</p>

<p>After the conversion of the Anglo-Saxons to Christianity,
Easter, Whitsuntide, and Christmas, were kept as solemn
festivals; the kings living at those times in great state, wearing
their crowns, receiving company on a large scale, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
treating them with great hospitality. The Wittenagemots
were also then held, and important affairs of church and state
discussed. Knowing the affection of the early Saxons for
their ale and mead, and that quaffing these from the skulls
of their enemies, while feasting from the great boar Scrymer,
was—notwithstanding the apparent sameness of the amusement—one
of their anticipated joys in a future state, we can
readily imagine that excesses frequently took place at these
festivals. The wassail bowl, of which the skull of an enemy
would thus appear to have formed their <i>beau idéal</i>, is said to
have been introduced by them. Rowena, the fair daughter
of Hengist, presenting the British king, Vortigern, with a
bowl of wine, and saluting him with “Lord King Wass-heil;”
to which he answered, as he was directed, “Drinc heile,”
and saluted her then after his fashion, being much smitten
with her charms. The purpose of father and daughter was
obtained; the king married the fair cup-bearer, and the
Saxons obtained what they required of him. This is said to
have been the first wassail in this land; but, as it is evident
that the form of salutation was previously known, the custom
must have been much older among the Saxons; and, indeed,
in one of the histories, a knight, who acts as a sort of interpreter
between Rowena and the king, explains it to be an
old custom among them. By some accounts, however, the
Britons are said themselves to have had their wassail bowl,
or lamb’s wool—<i>La Mas Ubhal</i>, or day of apple fruit—as far
back as the third century, made of ale, sugar (whatever
their sugar was), toast and roasted crabbs, hissing in the
bowl; to which, in later times, nutmeg was added. The
followers of Odin and Thor drank largely in honour of their
pagan deities; and, when converted, still continued their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
potations, but in honour of the Virgin Mary, the Apostles,
and Saints; and the early missionaries were obliged to submit
to this substitution, being unable to abolish the practice,
which afterwards degenerated into drinking healths of other
people, to the great detriment of our own. Strange! that
even from the earliest ages, the cup-bearer should be one of
the principal officers in the royal presence, and that some of
the high families take their name from a similar office.</p>

<p>The feast of Christmas was kept in the same state on the
Continent, and the bishops were accustomed to send their
eulogies—<i>Visitationis Scripta</i>—on the Nativity, to kings,
queens, and others of the blood royal. But it is foreign to
the purpose of this work to refer to the customs abroad,
unless it may be necessary to do so slightly, for the purpose
of illustration. It may be mentioned, however, that at this
festival, in 800, Charlemagne received from the pope,
Leo the Third, the crown of Emperor, and was hailed
as the pious Augustus the Great, and pacific Emperor of
the Romans.</p>

<p>Alfred, as might be expected from his fine character, reverently
observed the festival. On one occasion he gave to the
celebrated Asser, by way of gift, an abbey, in Wiltshire,
supposed to have been Amesbury; another, at Barnwell, in
Somersetshire; a rich silk pall, and as much incense as a
strong man could carry on his shoulder,—a truly princely
New Year’s gift. He directed Christmas to be kept for twelve
days; so that now, if not at an earlier date, the length of the
feast was defined, and the name, probably, of Twelfth-day
given to the last day of it; though, in the old Runic festivals,
among the ancient Danes, it appears to have been more correctly
called the thirteenth day, a name which would sound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
uncouth to our modern ears: Who would eat any thirteenth
cake? Alfred was commemorating this festival, with his army,
at Chippenham, in 878, when he was surprised by Guthrum,
and his Danes, and compelled to fly and conceal himself in
the Isle of Athelney, his power fading away for a time, even
like that of a twelfth-night king. Something similar happened
a century before, when Offa, king of Mercia, about the year
790, was completing Offa’s dyke. The Welsh, despising the
solemnity of the time, broke through, and slew many of Offa’s
soldiers, who were enjoying their Christmas. The Danish
kings kept the feast much in the same manner as the Saxons;
and there is a story told of Canute, who had many good
qualities about him, which shows the rudeness of the times,
even in the royal circle, though such a scene may even now
be realized in Oriental courts. While this monarch was
celebrating his Christmas in London, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1017, Edric, earl
of Mercia, who had treacherously betrayed and deserted
Ethelred and Edmund Ironside, boasted of his services to
Canute, who turned to Eric, earl of Northumberland, exclaiming,
“Then let him receive his deserts, that he may not
betray us, as he betrayed Ethelred and Edmund.” The
Norwegian immediately cut him down with his battle-axe,
and his body was thrown from a window into the Thames.
Such speedy justice would rather astonish a drawing-room
now-a-days.</p>

<p>Dancing seems then, even as at present, to have been a
favourite Christmas amusement, and certainly in one instance
was carried to an extreme. Several young persons were
dancing and singing together on Christmas Eve, 1012, in
a churchyard, and disturbed one Robert, a priest, who was
performing mass in the church. He entreated them in vain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
to desist: the more he begged the more they danced, and,
we may conclude, showed him some of their best <i>entrechâts</i>
and capers. What would, in modern times, have been a case
for the police, was then a subject for the solemn interference
of the powers of the church. Robert, as they would not
cease dancing, as the next best thing, prayed that they might
dance without ceasing. So they continued without intermission,
for a whole year, feeling neither heat nor cold, hunger
nor thirst, weariness nor decay of apparel; but the ground on
which they performed not having the same miraculous support,
gradually wore away under them, till at last they were
sunk in it up to the middle, still dancing as vehemently as
ever. Sir Roger de Coverley, danced down the whole length
of the Crystal Palace, would have been nothing to this. A
brother of one of the girls took her by the arm, endeavouring
to bring her away; the limb, however, came off in his hand,
like Dr. Faustus’s leg, in the hand of the countryman, but
the girl never stopped her dancing, or missed a single step in
consequence. At the end of the year Bishop Hubert came
to the place, when the dancing ceased, and he gave the party
absolution. Some of them died immediately after, and the
remainder, after a profound sleep of three days and three
nights, went about the country to publish the miracle.</p>

<p>It was at Christmas, 1065, that Westminster Abbey was
consecrated, in the presence of Queen Edgitha, and a great
number of nobles and priests, Edward the Confessor being
himself too ill to attend; and indeed he died on the 5th of
January, 1066, and was buried in the Abbey on the following
day; his tomb there, and his name of the Confessor, given
him by the priests, having caused him probably to be better
known than any particular merits of his own deserve.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>A great change was now about to take place in the
government of our country: William of Normandy claimed
it as his of right against Harold; and, having power to
support his claim, in the space of a few months became
King of England, placing his Norman followers in the high
places of the land.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-t.jpg" width="134" height="136" alt="T" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capi2">THE Anglo-Norman kings introduced increased
splendour at this festival, as they
did on all other occasions; the king wearing
his crown and robes of state, and the prelates
and nobles attending, with great pomp and
ceremony, to partake of the feast provided by their monarch,
and to receive from him presents, as marks of his royal favour;
returning, probably, more than an equivalent. William the
Conqueror, was crowned on Christmas day, 1066.</p>

<p>
“On Christmas day in solemne sort,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Then was he crowned here,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">By Albert, Archbishop of Yorke,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">With many a noble peere.”</span><br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>There was some disturbance during the ceremony, owing
to the turbulence or misconception of his Norman followers,
who, as well as their master, were disposed to rule with a rod
of iron. William gave a striking proof of how little his
nature was capable of understanding “good will towards
men,” when he kept his Christmas at York, in 1069, with the
usual festivities, and afterwards gave directions to devastate
the country between York and Durham; thus consigning
100,000 people to death, by cold, hunger, fire, and sword.
Well, perhaps some of us are William the Conquerors in
heart; what else is a bully at school, or a bully in society,
or, yet more, a bully in domestic life? Who can count the
misery caused by one selfish, one imperious tyrant, whose
victims dare not, or will not, complain; the crouching child,
the trembling, submissive, broken-hearted, yet even still the
loving wife? Oh! woman,—woman, how few amongst us are
able to appreciate you! We see you fair and accomplished;
we find you loving and affectionate; we know you virtuous
and faithful; but, can we estimate your truthfulness, your
negation of self, your purity of thought? Partakers of our
joys, but partners indeed in our sorrows; how many a weary
heart of man, crushed by the pressure of worldly cares and
trials, have you not saved, and brought to the contemplation
of better things! “She openeth her mouth with wisdom;
and in her tongue is the law of kindness.”</p>

<p>It would be easy to give a list of the different places where
our monarchs kept their Christmasses, from the time of the
Conquest, in nearly, if not quite, an unbroken series; but as
this would be scarcely as amusing as a few pages in a well
conducted dictionary, it will no doubt be considered to have
been wisely omitted. It may be stated, in general terms,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
that the earlier kings occasionally passed Christmas in
Normandy, and that some of the principal towns favoured,
besides London and Westminster, appear to have been,
Windsor, York, Winchester, Norwich, Worcester, Gloucester,
Oxford, Eltham, and Canterbury; and in the time of the
Tudors, Greenwich. Some examples of marked or distinguished
Christmasses will be given in the following pages.</p>

<p>In 1085, William, who was fond of magnificence, kept his
Christmas with great state at Gloucester, which was a favourite
place with him and his son William. He was either in a
particular good humour, or wished to perform what he might
think an act of grace, and compensate the severity with
which he treated his conquered, or rather semi-conquered
new subjects, by showing favour to his own countrymen;—a
sort of liberal disposition of public gifts to family friends,
that may be seen occasionally even in modern times—so
he gave bishoprics to three of his chaplains, namely, that
of London to Maurice, of Thetford to William, and of
Chester to Robert. There is a somewhat strange regulation
among the constitutions of Archbishop Lanfranc for the
government of the monks of his cathedral, which contain
numerous injunctions respecting washing and combing, and
other matters that would now surprise even a well-regulated
boys’ school. On Christmas Eve they are directed to comb
their heads before they washed their hands, while at other
times they were to wash first, and comb afterwards. We do
not see the philosophy of this curious distinction.</p>

<p>William Rufus, the weak and profligate successor of the
Conqueror, kept the Christmas in state, like his father, and
Henry the First followed their example; even in 1105,
which was “annus valde calamitosus,” wherein he raised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
many tributes, he still kept his Christmas in state, at
Windsor. In 1116, he kept it at St. Albans, when the celebrated
monastery there was consecrated. In the Christmas
1126-7, which was held at Windsor, anticipating the struggle
for the crown that would take place after his death, he
assembled all the principal clergy and nobles (David, king
of Scots, being also present), and caused them to swear
that they would maintain England and Normandy for his
daughter, the Empress Matilda, after his death. In these
early times, however, a few oaths, more or less, were of little
consequence; the “time whereof the memory of man runneth
not to the contrary” was of very short date; a week
sometimes making a man to forget utterly what he might
previously have sworn to; and the vicar of Bray would have
been by no means a reprehensible character.</p>

<p>King Stephen, after his accession, wore his crown and
robes of state like the former kings, and kept his Christmas
at London; but about the fifth year of his reign, the internal
wars and tumults became and continued of such magnitude,
that during the remainder of this troubled reign, the celebration
of festivals was laid aside.</p>

<p>Henry the Second renewed the celebration of Christmas
with great splendour, and with plays and masques; and the
lord of Misrule appears to have been known at this time, if
not at a much earlier date. In 1171, he celebrated the feast
at Dublin, in a large wooden house erected for the purpose,
and entertained several of the Irish chieftains, as well as the
principal men of his own court and army; the Irish were
much surprised at the great plenty and variety of provisions,
and were especially amused at the English eating cranes;
however, after a very short hesitation they joined readily in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
the feasting themselves, and history does not say that any
ill effects followed. Cranes continued to be favourites at
Christmas and aristocratic feasts for some time; at the
celebrated and often quoted enthronisation banquet of Archbishop
Nevil, in the time of Edward the Fourth, there were no
less than 204 of these birds. There were some strange
dishes, however, in vogue in the time of Henry the Second,
as far as the names, whatever the actual merits of the compounds
might have been. Dillegrout, karumpie, and maupigyrnun,
may have far surpassed some of our grand sounding
modern dishes, where the reality sadly disappoints the ear.
This dillegrout also was rather an important dish, as the
tenant of the manor of Addington, in Surrey, held it by
service of making a mess of dillegrout on the day of the
coronation. Fancy the anxiety on this ceremony, not only
for the excellence of the dish, but that it shall not be proclaimed
a failure, and thus risk the possession of the manor,
and some more favoured tenant being put in possession, on
the tenure of providing a plum-pudding every Christmas, or
something similar, like the celebrated King George’s pudding,
still tendered to visitors at the Isle of Portland. This dillegrout,
too, required some little skill to make it well, being
compounded of almond milk, the brawn of capons, sugar and
spices, chicken parboiled and chopped, and was called, also,
‘le mess de gyron,’ or, if there was fat with it, it was termed
maupigyrnun.</p>

<p>At Christmas, 1176, Roderick, king of Connaught, kept
court with Henry at Windsor, and in 1183, Henry kept the
feast at Caen, in Normandy, and there wished his son Henry
(who died not long afterwards) to receive homage from his
brothers; but the impetuous Richard would not consent, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
“merry” Christmas was, therefore, sadly interrupted, and
fresh family feuds arose; they had previously been but too
frequent, Henry’s life having been much embittered by the
conduct of his sons.</p>

<p>When Richard himself came to the throne, he gave a
splendid entertainment during Christmas, 1190, at Sicily,
when on his way to the Crusades, inviting every one in the
united English and French armies of the degree of a gentleman,
and giving each a suitable present, according to his
rank. Notwithstanding, however, the romance of Richard
Cœur de Lion affirms that—</p>

<p>
“Christmas is a time full honest,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Kyng Richard it honoured with gret feste;”</span><br />
</p>

<p>and an antiquary of course ought to consider these romances
of equal authenticity with the old chronicles; yet one cannot
help thinking that during Richard’s short reign, his captivity
and his absence from his kingdom must have interfered with
his Christmas celebrations; in fact, he, of the lion-heart,
seems to have been more ornamental than useful in the
pages of history.</p>

<p>John celebrated the feast pretty regularly, but seems occasionally
to have selected a city or town for the purpose,
where some great personage was allowed to provide for the
entertainment; as, for instance, the celebrated Hubert de
Burgh, at Canterbury, in 1203. In 1213, he kept his
Christmas at Windsor with great festivity, and gave many
presents. He was accustomed to make a present to his
chancellor, every Christmas, of two marks of gold, according
to ancient custom, no doubt by way of New Year’s gift, and
gave him half that value at Easter and Whitsuntide. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
1214, he was keeping his Christmas at Worcester, when he
was informed of the resolution of the barons to withdraw
their allegiance, unless their claims were attended to. This
information being ill-suited for the festivities then in progress,
the king departed suddenly and shut himself up in the
Temple; but the barons went to him on the Epiphany of 1215
with their demands, to which he promised a satisfactory
answer at the ensuing Easter. The dissensions between
himself and his barons, ending in Magna Charta, are well-known
matters of history. In the following year the chief
barons of the realm were under sentence of excommunication,
and the city of London was under an interdict; but the
citizens disregarded this, kept open their churches, rang their
bells, enjoyed their turtle and whitebait (whatever the turtle
and whitebait of that time might have been), drank their
hippocras, ale, mead, and claret or clarré, and celebrated their
Christmas with unusual festivity. The English had long been
celebrated for their pre-eminence in drinking; as Iago says,
“your Dane, your German, and your swag-bellied Hollander,
are nothing to your English.” They probably inherited the
talent from the Saxons, for their kings had their wine, mead,
cyder, ale, pigment, and morat, to which their Norman successors
added claret or clarré, garhiofilac, and hippocras.
Morat was made from honey and mulberries; claret, pigment,
hippocras, and garhiofilac (so called from the girofle or
cloves contained in it), were different preparations of wine
mixed with honey and spices, no doubt very palatable; and
hippocras particularly was indispensable at all the great feasts.
Garhiofilac was probably made of white wine, and claret of
red wine, as there is an order of Henry the Third in existence,
directing the keepers of his wines at York, to deliver to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
Robert de Monte Pessulano two tuns of white wine to make
garhiofilac, and one tun of red wine to make claret for him
at the ensuing Christmas, as he used to do in former years.
These sheriffs were very useful persons in those times, and
performed many offices for our olden monarchs that would
somewhat surprise a modern high sheriff to perform now,
when he is only called upon to attend to the higher duties of
his office, and becomes officially one of the first men in his
county. Henry the Third, in his twenty-sixth year, directed
the sheriff of Gloucester, to cause twenty salmons to be
bought for the king, and put into pies against Christmas;
and the sheriff of Sussex to buy ten brawns with the heads,
ten peacocks, and other provisions for the same feast.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<div class="caption">USHERING IN THE BOAR’S HEAD.</div>
</div>

<p>In his thirty-ninth year, the French king, having sent over
as a present to Henry (whether as a New Year’s gift or not
does not exactly appear) an elephant—“a beast most strange
and wonderfull to the English people, sith most seldome or
never any of that kind had beene seene before that time,”—the
sheriffs of London were commanded to build a house for
the same, forty feet long and twenty feet broad, and to
find necessaries for himself and keeper.</p>

<p>The boar’s head just referred to was the most distinguished
of the Christmas dishes, and there are several old carols
remaining in honour of it.</p>

<p>
“At the begynnyng of the mete,<br />
Of a borys hed ye schal hete,<br />
And in the mustard ye shal wete;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">And ye shal syngyn or ye gon.”</span><br />
</p>

<p>The dish itself, though the “chief service in this land,”
and of very ancient dignity—probably as old as the Saxons,—was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
not confined to Christmas; for, in 1170, when King
Henry the Second had his son Henry crowned in his own
lifetime, he himself, to do him honour, brought up the boar’s
head with trumpets before it, “according to the manner.”
It continued the principal entry at all grand feasts, and was
frequently ornamented. At the coronation feast of Henry
the Sixth there were boars’ heads in “castellys of golde and
enamell.” By Henry the Eighth’s time it had become an
established Christmas dish, and we find it ushered in at this
season to his daughter the Princess Mary, with all the usual
ceremonies, and no doubt to the table of the monarch himself,
who was not likely to dispense with so royal a dish; and
so to the time of Queen Elizabeth, and the revels in the
Inns of Court in her time, when at the Inner Temple a fair
and large boar’s head was served on a silver platter, with minstrelsy.
At the time of the celebrated Christmas dinner, at
Oxford, in 1607, the first mess was a boar’s head, carried by
the tallest of the guard, having a green scarf and an empty
scabbard, preceded by two huntsmen, one carrying a boar
spear and the other a drawn faucion, and two pages carrying
mustard, which seems to have been as indispensable as the
head itself. A carol was sung on the occasion, in the burden
of which all joined. Queen’s College, Oxford, was also celebrated
for its custom of bringing in the boar’s head with its
old carol. Even in the present day, though brawn, in most
cases, is considered as a sort of substitute, the boar’s head
with lemon in his mouth may be seen, though rarely, and when
met with, may be safely recommended as a dainty; but some
of the <i>soi-disant</i> boars’ heads seen at Christmas in a pompous
state of whiskerless obesity, may without disparagement take
Lady Constance’s words literally and “hang a calf skin on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
their recreant limbs.” Brawn is probably as old as boar’s
head; but the inventor of such an arrangement of hogsflesh
must have been a genius, and would have been a patentee
in our days, and probably have formed a joint-stock brawn
association. We have just observed it in the time of Henry
the Third, and the ‘begging frere,’ in ‘Chaucer’s Sompnoure’s
Tales,’ says, “geve us of your braun, if ye have any,” and it
may be found in most of the coronation and grand feasts;
even in the coronation feast of Katharine, queen to Henry
the Fifth, in 1421, brawn and mustard appear, though the
feast was intended to be strictly a fish dinner, and with this
exception and a little confectionary, really was so, comprising,
with other marine delicacies, “fresh sturgion with welks,”
and “porperous rosted,” the whole bill of fare, however,
would match even the ministerial whitebait dinner. This is
not the only instance where brawn was ranked with fish; for
when Calais was taken, there was a large quantity there; so
the French, guessing it to be some dainty, tried every means
of cooking it; they roasted it, boiled it, baked it, but all in
vain, till some imaginative mind suggested a trial <i>au naturel</i>,
when its merits were discovered. But now came the question,
in what class of the animal creation should it be placed? The
monks tasted and admired: “Ha! ha!” said they, “capital
fish!” and immediately placed it on their list of fast-day provisions.
The Jews were somewhat puzzled, but a committee
of taste, of the most experienced elders, decided that it
certainly was not any preparation from impure swine, and
included it in their list of clean animals.</p>

<p>At the coronation of Henry the Seventh, a distinction was
made between “brawne royall,” and “brawne,” the former
probably being confined to the king’s table. Brawn and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
mustard appear to be as inseparable as the boar’s head and
mustard, and many directions respecting them may be found
at early feasts. In the middle of the sixteenth century
brawn is called a great piece of service, chiefly in Christmas
time, but as it is somewhat hard of digestion, a draught of
malvesie, bastard, or muscadell is usually drunk after it, where
either of them is conveniently to be had.</p>

<p>
“Even the two rundlets,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The two that was our hope, of muscadel,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">(Better ne’er tongue tript over,) these two cannons,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">To batter brawn withal, at Christmas, sir,—</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Even these two lovely twins, the enemy</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Had almost cut off clean.”</span><br />
</p>

<p>At the palace, and at the revels of the Inns of Court, it
seems to have been a constant dish at a Christmas breakfast.
Tusser prescribes it amongst his good things for Christmas,
and it has so remained to the present time. The salmon
recently mentioned, as having been ordered for the king,
continued to be a favourite dish for this feast. Carew says—</p>

<p>
“Lastly, the sammon, king of fish,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Fils with good cheare the Christmas dish.”</span><br />
</p>

<p>There used to be a superstition at Aberavon, in Monmouthshire,
that every Christmas Day, in the morning, and then
only, a large salmon exhibited himself in the adjoining river,
and permitted himself to be handled and taken up, but it
would have been the greatest impiety to have captured him.
One would not wish to interfere with the integrity of this
legend, by calling on the salmon some Christmas morning,
for fear that he may have followed the tide of emigration, or
may have been affected by free trade.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>The salmon, however, is not the only living creature, besides
man, that is supposed to venerate this season.</p>

<p>
“Some say, that ever ’gainst that season comes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Wherein our Saviour’s birth is celebrated,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The bird of dawning singeth all night long:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And then, they say, no spirit can walk abroad;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">No fairy tales, nor witch hath power to charm,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">So hallow’d and so gracious is the time.”</span><br />
</p>

<p>According to popular superstition the bees are heard to
sing, and the labouring cattle may be seen to kneel, on this
morning, in memory of the cattle in the manger, and the
sheep to walk in procession, in commemoration of the glad
tidings to the shepherds.</p>

<p>Howison, in his ‘Sketches of Upper Canada,’ mentions an
interesting incident of his meeting an Indian at midnight,
on Christmas Eve, during a beautiful moonlight, cautiously
creeping along, and beckoning him to silence, who, in answer
to his inquiries, said, “Me watch to see the deer kneel; this
is Christmas night, and all the deer fall upon their knees to
the Great Spirit, and look up.”</p>

<p>In our notice of Christmas wines, we must not omit malt-wine
or ale, which may be considered, indeed, as our national
beverage.</p>

<p>
“The nut-brown ale, the nut-brown ale,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Puts downe all drinke when it is stale,”</span><br />
</p>

<p>or, as it has been classically rendered, alum <i>si sit stalum</i>.
The Welsh who are still famous for their ale, had early laws
regulating it, while the steward of the king’s household had
as much of every cask of plain ale as he could reach with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
middle finger dipped into it; and as much of every cask of
spiced ale as he could reach with the second joint of his
middle finger. As millers are remarkable for the peculiarity
of their thumbs, no doubt these stewards were gifted with
peculiarly long middle fingers. Ale, or beer, was afterwards
divided into single beer, or small ale, double beer, double-double
beer, and dagger ale; there was, also, a choice kind,
called March ale; and our early statute books contain several
laws regulating the sale of ale, which was to be superintended
by an ale-taster, and the terrors of the pillory and cucking-stool
held over misdemeanants.</p>

<p>It maybe expected that “Christmas broached the mightiest
ale,” and Christmas ale has, accordingly, been famous from
the earliest times.—</p>

<p>
“Bryng us in good ale, and bryng us in good ale,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">For our blyssd Lady sake, bring us in good ale,”</span><br />
</p>

<p>is a very old wassailing cry, and the wandering musicians
always expected a black jack of ale and a Christmas pye.
A favourite draught, also, was spiced ale with a toast, stirred
up with a sprig of rosemary,—“Mark you, sir, a pot of ale
consists of four parts: imprimis, the ale, the toast, the ginger,
and the nutmeg.” Mead, or metheglin, was another national
drink, and here the steward was only allowed as far as he
could reach in the cask with the first joint of his middle
finger. That metheglin was so called from one Matthew
Glinn, who had a large stock of bees that he wished to
make profitable, must be considered more as a joke than a
tradition.</p>

<p>Henry the Third generally kept his Christmasses with
festivities. In 1230, there was a grand one at York, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
King of Scots being present; but four years afterwards he
kept it at Gloucester, with only a small company, many of
the nobles having left him in consequence of the great favour
he was showing foreigners, to their injury. In 1241, he
again offended them by placing the Pope’s legate, at the
great dinner at Westminster Hall, in the place of honour,
that is, the middle, he himself sitting on the right-hand, the
Archbishop of York (the Archbishop of Canterbury being dead)
on his left-hand, and then the prelates and nobles, according
to rank. This etiquette, as to place at table, is certainly as
old as the Egyptians, and many a wronged or neglected
individual’s dinner has been spoilt, who has failed in getting
such a place above the salt, or at the cross table, as he considered
his merits entitled him to.</p>

<p>On one occasion, in his forty-second year, Henry rather
took undue advantage of the custom of the season, and being
distressed for money, required compulsory New Year’s Gifts
from the Londoners. His wars frequently distressed him for
money, and in 1254, his queen sent him, to Gascoigne, 500
marks from her own revenues, as a New Year’s Gift, toward
the maintenance of them. In several instances, he kept his
Christmasses at the expense of some of the great nobles, as
Hubert de Burgh, and Peter, bishop of Winchester, who, in
1232, not only took all the expense upon himself, but gave
the king and all his court festive garments; and, in another
year, when Alexander, King of Scots, married his daughter
Margaret, the Archbishop of York, where the feast was held,
gave 600 fat oxen, which were all spent at one meal, and expended
4000 marks besides. This convenient practice saved
the pocket of the sovereign, and gratified the ambition of the
subject; but the great expense caused by such a favour,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
must have been something like the costly present of an
elephant, by an Eastern despot, to a subject. In his later
years, the king laid aside hospitality very much.</p>

<p>The three Edwards kept the feast much as before, and
Edward the First is said to have been the first king who kept
any solemn feast at Bristol, holding his Christmas there in
1284. In his wardrobe accounts, there are some valuable
particulars of the custom of the king at this time. In
pursuance of ancient usage, he offered at the high altar, on
the Epiphany, one golden florin, frankincense, and myrrh, in
commemoration of the offering of the three kings; a custom
carried down with some variation to the present day. In the
same accounts, some of the New Year’s Gifts given to him
are mentioned; among them, a large ewer set with pearls all
over, with the arms of England, Flanders, and Barr, a present
from the countess of Flanders; a comb and looking-glass of
silver-gilt enamelled, and a bodkin of silver in a leathern case,
from the countess of Barr; also, a pair of large knives of
ebony and ivory, with studs of silver enamelled, given by the
Lady Margaret, his daughter, duchess of Brabant.</p>

<p>The custom of giving New Year’s Gifts existed from the
earliest period, and as Warmstry, in his ‘Vindication,’ says,
may be “harmless provocations to Christian love, and mutuall
testimonies thereof to good purpose, and never the worse
because the heathens have them at the like times.” The
Romans had their Xenia and Strenæ, during the Saturnalia,
which were retained by the Christians, whence came the French
term <i>étrennes</i>; a very ancient one, for in the old mystery,
“Li Gieus de Robin et de Marion,” in the thirteenth century,
Marion says, she will play, “aux jeux qu’on fait aux étrennes,
entour la veille de Noël.” The Greek word strenæ, is translated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
in our New Testament, delicacies; so that, whether
delicacies were called strenæ because such gifts were generally
of an elegant or graceful nature, or the New Year’s Gifts
adopted a word previously applied to delicacies, seems immaterial,
as the result is the same. These “diabolical New
Year’s Gifts,” as some called them, were denounced by certain
of the councils, as early as the beginning of the seventh century,
though without effect. They were either in the nature
of an offering from an inferior to his superior, who gave
something in return, or an interchange of gifts between equals.
Tenants were accustomed to give capons to their landlords at
this season, and in old leases, a capon, at Christmas, is sometimes
reserved as a sort of rent,—</p>

<p>
“Yet must he haunt his greedy landlord’s hall,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">With often presents at ech festivall;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">With crammed capons ev’ry New Year’s morne.”</span><br />
</p>

<p>The practice of New Year’s Gifts is of great antiquity in
this country. In the twelfth century, Jocelin of Brakelond,
when about to make a gift to his abbot, refers to it, as being
according to the custom of the English; and, in very early
times, the nobility, and persons connected with the court,
gave these New Year’s Gifts to the monarch, who gave in
return presents of money, or of plate, the amount of which in
time became quite a matter of regulation; and the messenger,
bringing the gift, had, also, a handsome fee given him. How
much kindly feeling is caused by the interchange of these
gifts, and how much taste and fancy displayed at Fortnum
and Mason’s, and other places, to tempt us to purchase for the
gratification of our younger friends, and receive our reward in
the contemplation of their unfeigned pleasure and amusement!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
Humorous and witty, as well as elegant, bon-bons and
souvenirs, drawing the money from us like so many magnets;
as Nasgeorgus says—</p>

<p>
“These giftes the husband gives his wife,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And father eke the childe,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And maister on his men bestowes</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">The like, with favour milde.”</span><br />
</p>

<p>There are some particulars in the wardrobe accounts of the
New Year’s Gifts of Edward the Second, and also payments
made to him to play at dice at Christmas; a custom existing
probably long before his time, and certainly continued down
to a comparatively recent period, gambling at the groom-porter’s
having been observed as late as the time of George
the Third. He also gave numerous gifts, being, as is well
known, of extravagant and luxurious habits. In his eleventh
year, especially, at Westminster, several knights received
sumptuous presents of plate from him, and the king of the
bean (Rex Fabæ) is mentioned as receiving handsome silver-gilt
basins and ewers as New Year’s Gifts. Two of the kings
of the bean named, are, Sir William de la Bech, and Thomas
de Weston, squire of the king’s household. Edward kept
several stately Christmasses, and one at Nottingham in 1324,
with particular magnificence, glory, and resort of people.
Even when a prisoner at Kenilworth in 1326-7, he kept up a
degree of state, although his son, Edward the Third, then aged
about sixteen years, was crowned on Christmas Day, 1326,
the queen-mother keeping open court, with a great assembly
of nobles, prelates, and burgesses, when it was decided to
depose the father, whose melancholy fate is well known.
Edward the Third became not only a great warrior, but, also,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
in many respects, a great monarch, and his Christmasses, with
other feasts, were held with much splendour. One at Wells,
where there were many strange and sumptuous shows made
to pleasure the king and his guests, is particularly mentioned;
but that at Windsor, in 1343-4, is by far the most
distinguished in history, as the king then renewed the Round
Table, and instituted the celebrated Order of the Garter,
making St. George the patron; whether from the circumstance
of the countess of Salisbury having dropped her garter
(whence the old Welsh tune took its name of Margaret has
lost her garter), cannot now be distinctly proved; but we may
as well leave the balance in favour of gallantry. Suffice it,
that never has any order of knighthood enrolled such a succession
of royal, brave, and world-renowned characters. In
1347 at Guildford, and 1348 at Ottford, in Kent, there were
great revellings at Christmas. In the first of these years,
there were provided for the amusements of the court, eighty-four
tunics of buckram, of divers colours; forty-two visors of
different likenesses; twenty-eight crests; fourteen coloured
cloaks; fourteen dragons’ heads; fourteen white tunics;
fourteen heads of peacocks, with wings; fourteen coloured
tunics, with peacocks’ eyes; fourteen heads of swans, with
wings; fourteen coloured tunics of linen; and fourteen
tunics, coloured, with stars of gold and silver. In the following
year, quadrupeds were in the ascendancy, instead of
the feathered creation, and amongst the things mentioned in
the wardrobe expenses are, twelve heads of men, surmounted
by those of elephants; twelve of men, having heads of lions
over them; twelve of men’s heads, having bats’ wings; and,
twelve heads of wodewoses, or wildmen. A good pantomime
decorator would have been invaluable in those days. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
New Year’s Eve 1358, Edward, with his gallant son, were in a
different scene, fighting under the banners of Sir Walter de
Mauny before the walls of Calais, which place the French
thought had been betrayed to them; but the plot was counteracted,
and they were defeated, and many French knights
made captives, who were hospitably entertained by the English
king on the following day, being New Year’s Day.</p>

<p>The mummeries, or disguises, just referred to, were known
here as early as the time of Henry the Second, if not sooner,
and may have been derived originally from the heathen custom
of going about, on the kalends of January, in disguises, as wild
beasts and cattle, and the sexes changing apparel. They
were not confined to the diversions of the king and his nobles;
but a ruder class was in vogue among the inferior orders,
where, no doubt, abuses were occasionally introduced in consequence.
Even now, our country geese or guise dancers are
a remnant of the same custom, and, in some places, a horse’s
head still accompanies these mummers. The pageants, in
former times, of different guilds or trades, some of which
still exist, and, at the Lord Mayor’s shows, had all probably
a common origin, modified by circumstances; but, with
respect to those of the city, I must refer to Mr. Fairholt’s
account, printed for the Percy Society, where he has treated
largely on the subject. Who knows how many juvenile
citizens may not have been fired by ambition at the sight of
these soul-stirring spectacles, to becoming common councilmen,
aldermen, sheriffs, and lord-mayors themselves—to have
at their beck, the copper-cased knights; the brazen trumpets;
the prancing horses, bedecked with streamers; the marshalmen,
in martial attire; gilded coach, with the sword of state
looking out of window!—and then the charms of the dinner,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
in all the magnificence of turtle-soup, barons of beef, champagne,
venison, and minced pies, with Gog and Magog looking
benignly on; though they must miss the times, when the
Lord Mayor’s Fool used to jump into a huge bowl of Almayn
custard.</p>

<p>Edward the Third gave and received New Year’s Gifts, as
former kings; and we find an instance of presents given to
Roger Trumpony and his companions, minstrels of the king,
in the name of the king of the bean. He also made the
usual oblations at the Epiphany.</p>

<p>The continental usages were, in many places, similar to
our own; but, as before intimated, they will be but slightly
noticed. Charles the Fifth, of France, for instance, in 1377,
held the feast of Christmas, or Noël as it was called, at
Cambray, “et là, fist ses sérimonies impériaulx, selon l’usage,”
referring evidently to old customs; he also presented gold,
incense, and myrrh, in three gilt cups. Not many years
afterwards, the duke of Burgundy gave New Year’s Gifts
of greater value than any one, and especially to all the
nobles and knights of his household, to the value of 15,000
golden florins; but there was probably as much policy in this,
as any real regard for the sacred festival.</p>

<p>Richard the Second was young when he came to the throne,
extravagant, fond of luxury and magnificence, and the vagaries
of fashion in dress were then, and for a long time after, unequalled;
his dress, was “all jewels, from jasey to his diamond
boots.” It is to be expected, therefore, that his Christmasses
were kept in splendour, regardless of expense; and this appears
to have been the case even to the close of his short and
unfortunate reign; as, in 1399, there was a royal Christmas at
Westminster, with justings and running at the tilt throughout,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
and from twenty-six to twenty-eight oxen, with three hundred
sheep, and fowls without number, were consumed every day.
In the previous Christmas, at Lichfield where the Pope’s
nuncio and several foreign gentlemen were present, there
were spent two hundred tuns of wine, and two thousand
oxen, with their appurtenances. It is to be assumed that
the pudding was in proportion to the beef; so these, in point
of feasting, must have been royal Christmasses indeed.</p>

<p>In the midst of all this grandeur, there was a want of cleanliness
and comfort in the rush-strewn floors and imperfectly
furnished rooms and tables, that would have been very evident
to a modern guest; and the manners at table, even in good
society, would rather shock our present fastidious habits.
Chaucer, not long previously, in describing the prioresse,
who appears to have been a well-bred and educated person
for the time, proves the usual slovenliness of the domestic
habits, by showing what she avoided—</p>

<p>
“At mete was she wel ytaughte withalle;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">She lette no morsel from hire lippes falle,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Ne wette hire fingres in hire sauce depe.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Wel coude she carie a morsel, and wel kepe,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Thatte no drope ne felle upon hire brest.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">In curtesie was sette ful moche hire lest.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Hire over lippe wiped she so clene,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">That in hire cuppe was no ferthing sene,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Of grese, whan she dronken hadde hire draught.”</span><br />
</p>

<p>or, according to the Roman de la Rose, from whence Chaucer
took this account,—</p>

<p>
“Et si doit si sagement boyre,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Que sur soy n’en espande goutte.”</span><br />
</p>

<p>It must be remembered, however, that there were no forks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
in those days. The Boke of Curtasye of the same age, reprobates
a practice that is even now scarcely obsolete, and
may unexpectedly be seen in company, where it excites surprise,
to say the least of it;—</p>

<p>
“Clense not thi tethe at mete sittande,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">With knyfe ne stre, styk ne wande.”</span><br />
</p>

<p>Richard also had his pageants, or disguisings, but instead
of looking to the brute or feathered creation for models, we
find, on one occasion, there is a charge for twenty-one linen
coifs for counterfeiting men of the law, in the king’s play or
diversion at Christmas, 1389. If the men of the law had
been as plentiful as at present, there would have been no
need of making any counterfeits, where a sufficient quantity
of real ones might have been procured so cheap. The unfortunate
Richard was murdered on Twelfth Day, 1400, a sad
finish to all his Christmasses. At the same time, a plan was
laid by the earls of Kent and Huntingdon (recently degraded
from the dukedoms of Exeter and Surrey), with the earl of
Salisbury and others, to gain access, under colour of a Christmas
mumming, at Windsor, where Henry the Fourth and the
princes were keeping the feast, and thus effect the restoration
of Richard; but one of the conspirators, the earl of Rutland
(degraded from duke of Aumarle), gave timely notice of it, in
order, as it is said, to forestal his father, the duke of York, who
had got some knowledge of the plot. Henry the Fourth
kept his Christmas feasts in the usual style, and does not
require any particular notice, which might tend to needless
repetition.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-t.jpg" width="134" height="136" alt="T" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capi2">THE wild course of Henry the Fifth, while
Prince of Wales, and his brilliant but short
career as king, are well known, and are
immortalised by Shakespeare;—</p>

<p>
“Never was such a sudden scholar made:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Never came reformation in a flood,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">With such a heady current, scouring faults;”</span><br />
</p>

<p>his historical plays have probably supplied many with their
principal knowledge of the early annals of our country, from
King Lear downwards; and we must not quarrel with the
dramatic fate of Cordelia, although her real story was more
prosperous, as we have, consequently, some of the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
pathetic passages in the works of our immortal bard—that is,
if such bard there ever was; for the overbearing mass of
intellect, imagination, and beauty, presented to us under the
name of Shakespeare, is such, that one almost considers the
name a myth, and decides that, at least, the Seven Sages must
have been engaged in its production. When his warlike
avocations allowed him Henry the Fifth kept the feast with
splendour; but his reign was nearly brought to a close at its
outset, if we are to believe those historians who state that,
when he was keeping the Christmas of 1413-14, at Eltham,
there was a plot for seizing him and his three brothers, and
the principal clergy, and killing them. As this plot was,
however, attributed to the Lollards, some of whom were taken
and executed, and rewards offered for Sir John Oldcastle,
Lord Cobham, imputing thereby the attempts to him, the
account must be taken with considerable allowance.</p>

<p>Even in the midst of the horrors of war Henry did not
forget the Christian mercies of this tide; for during the siege
of Rouen in his sixth year, and that city being in great extremity
from hunger, he ceased hostilities on Christmas Day,
and gave food to all his famishing enemies who would accept
of it.</p>

<p>
“Alle thay to have mete and drynke therto,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And, again, save condyte to come and to go.”</span><br />
</p>

<p>Something like this occurred, in 1428, at the siege of
Orleans, “where the solemnities and festivities of Christmas
gave a short interval of repose: the English lords requested
of the French commanders, that they might have a night of
minstrelsy with trumpets and clarions. They borrowed these
musicians and instruments from the French, and Dunois and
Suffolk also exchanged gifts.” In his eighth year, Henry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
with his queen, the “most fair” Katherine, sojourned at
Paris during the feast, and “kept such solemn estate, so
plentiful a house, so princely pastime, and gave so many gifts,
that from all parts of France, noblemen and others resorted to
his palace, to see his estate, and do him honour.” This was
a stroke of policy to ingratiate himself with the French, and
the French king at the same time kept his Christmas quietly.</p>

<p>Henry the Sixth, for the first few years of his troubled
reign, was a mere child; though, in the tenth year of his
reign, and the same of his age, having just previously
received the homage of the French and Norman nobles at
Paris, he celebrated the Feast with great solemnity at Rouen;
a place where, not long after, some of those in high places
of our country were to disgrace themselves by the cruel
punishment of Joan of Arc. He seems afterwards to have
kept his Christmas in the usual manner, until the disastrous
wars of York and Lancaster, during which the fate of the
monarch,—and, indeed, who, for the time being, was such
monarch—depended on the predominance of the white or red
rose.</p>

<p>There are several instances recorded of New Year’s Gifts,
or Christmas Boxes, given to and by him when a boy;
amongst others, to his mother Queen Katherine; to Queen
Jane, widow of Henry the Fourth; and, to the Cardinal
of England; being tablets of gold, ornamented with precious
stones. On one occasion he gave his mother a ruby, set in
a ring of gold, that the duke of Bedford had given him at a
previous Christmas. At another time he gave his mother
a tablet of gold, with a crucifix garnished with sapphires and
pearls, weighing about fourteen ounces of gold, which was
bought of John Patteslee, goldsmith, for forty pounds. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
usual payment to the heralds for their largess seems to have
been a hundred shillings. A small quarto book, with rich
illuminations, given to Henry by the abbot of Edmundsbury,
is now in the British Museum. The kings of arms and
heralds were accustomed, in preceding reigns, to have their
livery out of the great wardrobe, at Christmas, like other
squires of the court; but the practice having apparently got
into disuse during the boyhood of Henry, they petitioned, in
the eighteenth year of his reign, to have them again, which
was granted, and they again were decorated as at present, like
gilded court cards.</p>

<p>In 1428, a sum of four pounds was given to Jakke Travaill
and companions, for making divers plays and interludes before
the king, at Christmas.</p>

<p>Plays and interludes, with disguisings and mummings, were
of very ancient date, and derived, like many other things,
from the heathens. As early as 408 stage plays and spectacles
were forbidden by the Concilium Africanum, on the
Lord’s day, and other solemn Christian festivals, and by
several subsequent councils, whose orders seem to have been
but little attended to, showing how deep-rooted was the
attachment to these shows. The early secular plays, principally
performed by strolling minstrels, were frequently of a
comic nature, but of a gross character, and accompanied by
music, dancing, and mimicry. About the twelfth century
the ecclesiastics introduced miracle-plays and scripture-histories,
to counteract the secular plays, and these became
common in the time of Henry the Second; the miracle-play
of St. Katherine was acted at Dunstaple early in the twelfth
century. London became famous for them, and in some
places different trade-guilds produced each their separate play<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
or mystery, as we find in the case of the Chester and Coventry
Mysteries, and others. It was found expedient in these to
introduce some comic passages, to relieve the length of the
performances, and attract the notice of the audience, who
probably paid on the voluntary system, as each thought
proper. Thus, in the ‘Chester Mysteries,’ about the fourteenth
century, Noah’s wife refuses to go into the ark, without her
gossips, every one, and swears by Christ and by Saint John;
and when she is at last forced in, she salutes Noah with a
hearty box on the ear. In the Cornish Mystery of the
‘Creation of the World,’ by Jordan, which is, however, nearly
three centuries later in date, the lady is much more civil, and
is very careful to collect her property, like a thrifty housewife,
because “they cost store of money.” In the ‘Secunda
Pastorum’ of the Towneley Mysteries, which are said to be
about a century later than those of Chester, Mak, the buffoon
of the piece, steals a sheep from the Shepherds, while they
are asleep, and takes it home to his wife, who puts it into the
cradle, endeavouring to make it pass for a child, and praying
that if ever she beguiled the Shepherds, who have come in
search of it, she may eat the child lying there. The trick,
however, is discovered, one of the Shepherds, going to kiss the
child, finds the long snout. A similar story is told of Archie
Armstrong, the jester, in the seventeenth century, excepting
that his fraud was not discovered. In the ‘Slaughter of the
Innocents,’ a cowardly character, called Watkyn, requests
Herod to knight him, that he may be properly qualified to
assist; he is nevertheless well beaten by the women, and goes
to complain accordingly.</p>

<p>These Mysteries abound in anachronisms: Pharaoh in his
pursuit of the Israelites, when in fear of drowning, recommends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
his people to lift up their hearts to Mahownde, or Mahomet;
Herod constantly swears by him, sometimes even calling
him St. Mahomed, as the Sicilian peasants swear by <i>Santu
Diavolu</i>, and promises to make one of his counsellors Pope,
by way of reward; Noah’s wife swears by Mary; Caiaphas
sings mass; and the Shepherds are acquainted with the fools
of Gotham; but as individuals of this class are of a very
ancient, as well as lasting, breed, the statement may be
correct, if applied to some Gotham in Palestine. In the
‘Mactatio Abel,’ of the same collection, Cain is made to speak
in the rudest dialect of West York, using the vulgarest
phrases, with gross buffoonery.</p>

<p>The pilgrims and crusaders, on their return from the East,
introduced other subjects, and the frequent use of the name
of Mahomed or Mahomet may have some connection with
them. The Christmas play of St. George and the Dragon—</p>

<p>
“St. George! that swindg’d the dragon, and e’er since<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Sits on his horseback, at mine hostess’ door,”—</span><br />
</p>

<p>with the King of Egypt, and fair Sabra, his daughter, still
extant in some parts of the country, may have the same origin.
It is evidently of great antiquity; and the fact of its being
performed in similar manner in the extreme northern and
western parts of the country, a considerable part indeed being
nearly identical, tends to prove this. “St. George!” was the old
battle cry of the English, or “Sand Jors!” as an old German
poem, of the fourteenth century, on the battle of Poictiers,
calls it.</p>

<p>After the introduction of miracle-plays and mysteries, if
there was a deficiency at any time of ecclesiastical performers,
the clergy took secular players to assist them; and besides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
the fraternities and guilds, as before mentioned, some of the
public schools also claimed an exclusive privilege of performing
plays at particular times and places; the scholar
of Paul’s School, indeed, applied to Richard the Second to
prohibit inexperienced persons from presenting the ‘History
of the Old Testament,’ which the clergy had been at great
expense to represent publicly at Christmas. The parish-clerks
were also famed for their representations, which seem
frequently to have taken place at Clerkenwell, and occasionally
lasted for several days. One is mentioned by Stow, in 1409,
at Skinner’s Well, near Clerkenwell, which lasted eight days,
commencing from the Creation of the World; which was
indeed the favourite beginning, if we may judge from the sets
of mysteries still extant; the authors thinking that date
sufficiently remote: unlike some pedigree hunters, who some
way down their ornamented tree, place a note, stating that
about this time the world began; or the Chinese picture of the
Creation, which has, in a corner, a Chinese mandarin looking
on through a telescope. About the middle of the fifteenth
century, moralities, or morals, appear to have been introduced,
consisting of allegorical personifications, and with them the
Vice with his dagger of lath and fool’s coat. The scripture-plays
were not, however, immediately abandoned, and may be
met with, though perhaps in the shape of a puppet-show, as
late certainly as the time of Queen Anne, when at Heatley’s
Booth, at Bartholomew Fair, might be seen the old Creation
of the World, newly revived, commencing with the Creation
of Adam and Eve, and finishing with rich Dives in Hell, and
Lazarus in Abraham’s bosom. The French had representations
similar to those of the English, at least as early in
date; and, in 1313, Philippe-le-Bel exhibited, on the occasion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
of conferring knighthood on his children, the following
spectacles:—‘Adam et Eve;’ ‘Les Trois Rois;’ ‘Le Meurte des
Innocens;’ N. S. riant avec Sa Mère, et mangeant des pommes;
Hérode et Caiphe en mitre, &amp;c. In France, and in Spain,
where they had their Autos Sacramentales, as they called these
mysteries, from an equally early date, these performances
have been continued to modern times among the country
people, and most of their collections of carols contain two or
three short mysteries. The plays exhibited at court, during the
Christmas, were probably different from those of the clergy,
and more in the nature of mummeries, or disguisings, with
pageants, until the time of Queen Elizabeth, when the regular
drama was performed before her, a practice which has been
renewed in the elegant Christmas festivities of our present
Queen.</p>

<p>After Edward the Fourth became the undisputed king of
this country, he resumed the custom of keeping Christmas
with pomp, wearing his crown, and keeping his estate, and
making presents to his household; but the parliament nevertheless,
in 1465, thought it necessary to pass one of those
useless acts against excess in dress, forbidding cloth of gold,
and shoes with pikes more than two inches long, to any under
a lord. In 1461, also, all diceing, or playing at cards, was prohibited
except at Christmas. Cards forming then, as since, an
essential part, in many places, of the Christmas amusements.
Among the Christmas gifts, during this reign, several were
given to players and minstrels. Margery Paston, in a letter
to her husband John Paston, 24th Dec., 1484, says that his
eldest son had gone to Lady Morley to know how the Christmas
next after her husband’s death was kept, and that there
were no disguisings, nor harping, nor luting, nor singing, nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
loud disports; but playing at the tables, and chess, and
cards.</p>

<p>Richard the Third’s reign was too short and turbulent to
give much opportunity for festivities, but he nevertheless kept
two or three Christmasses in state, and particularly in 1484,
at Westminster, when he wore his crown at a royal banquet
on the Epiphany, clad in rich attire, of which he was fond;
and it was observed that the princess Elizabeth was dressed in
splendid robes of the same form and colour as those of the
queen, whence inferences were drawn that he wished to get
rid of the queen, either by death or divorce. Yet even now
we hardly know the real character of Richard, and whether
there were not some lights to relieve the dark shade:
ambitious he was, and unscrupulous, but eloquent, and brave
or bold; and perhaps, after all, his hump was only a high-shoulder.
The old Countess of Desmond, who danced with
him in her youth, describes him as a handsome man, somewhat
dazzled probably by dancing with royalty. Shakespeare has
rather treated him like a mad dog, and given him a bad name.</p>

<p>With Henry the Seventh commenced that series of splendid
Christmasses which lasted, with little interruption, until the
time of the civil wars, and were especially magnificent in the
first half of the reign of Henry the Eighth, and of which
historians have left us such particulars, that we can fancy ourselves
present at them. In Christmas, 1489, however, the
measles were prevalent, and proved fatal to several ladies and
gentlewomen, and there were no disguisings, and but few plays,
though there was an abbot of Misrule, who “made much
sport and did right well his office;” the ambassadors of Spain
dined at the king’s board on Twelfth Day, and the officers of
arms had their largess, as they were accustomed. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
following year, to make up for it, there was a goodly disguising
on New Year’s Night, and many plays during the Christmas.
There are some household books of this king still extant at
the Chapter-House, which contain many particulars of the
payments for the Christmas diversions. Among these
there are numerous gifts to different sets of players; dramatic
performances, such as they were, being frequent in this reign;
but the payments are somewhat of the smallest, varying from
ten shillings to £2. 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> for each set of players, excepting
on occasions when some of the gentlemen of his chapel played
before him, who received as much as £6. 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> for their
services, which sum appears also to have been the usual
reward for the lord of Misrule. It is probable, however, that
the players had rewards from other people besides the king,
and that when the cap was handed round a handsome collection
was frequently made. On one occasion no less than £12.
was given to a little maiden that danced: now, considering
how careful Henry was of his money, and comparing her
reward to that of the players, we must presume her to have
been the Taglioni of her day. The payments by the nobles
were frequently small; in Lord Howard’s account there is
one of 3<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> to four players.</p>

<p>Besides the plays, there were disguisings and banquets; and
Walter Alwyn and Jakes Haute had, at different Christmasses,
each £20 and upwards, for the disguisings or revels. In 1493,
on Twelfth Night, there was a great banquet and wassail, and
a pageant of Saint George with a castle; and twelve lords,
knights, and esquires, with twelve ladies, danced after the
wassail. Henry the Eighth at this time was but a fat-cheeked
child, so could scarcely reckon his taste for this sort of amusement—in
which he afterwards so much delighted—from so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
early a date, but had plenty of opportunities subsequently of
maturing it. On Twelfth Day the king made the accustomed
offerings of gold, myrrh, and frankincense: the dean of the
chapel sent to the Archbishop of Canterbury the offering by
a clerk or priest, who was to have the next benefice in the gift
of the archbishop. The king was to wear his crown and his
royal robes, kirtle, surcoat, furred hood, and mantle, with
long train, and his sword before him; his armills of gold
set with rich stones on his arms, and his sceptre in his right
hand.</p>

<p>The wassail was introduced in the evening with great ceremony:
the steward, treasurer, and comptroller of the household
went for it with their staves of office; the king’s and the
queen’s sewers, having fair towels round their necks, and dishes
in their hands, such as the king and queen should eat of; the
king’s and queen’s carvers following in like manner. Then
came in the ushers of the chamber, with the pile of cups—the
king’s, the queen’s, and the bishop’s—with the butlers and
wine, to the cupboard, or sideboard as we should now call it;
and squires of the body to bear them. The gentlemen of the
chapel stood at one end of the hall, and when the steward
came in with the wassail, he was to cry out three times,
“Wassail, wassail, wassail!” to which they answered with a good
song—no doubt a wassail song or a carol, as they were prevalent
at this time.</p>

<p>The terms wassail and wassailing are, as before mentioned,
of very early date. Mr. Hunter, in his interesting essay on
Robin Hood, notices a payment of a hundred shillings made,
in the time of Edward the Second, to Isabelle del Holde and
Alisoun Conand, damsels of the queen, for crying Noël
and Wessel. They were not, however, absolutely confined to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
Christmas, but were used to indicate any convivial and festive
meetings:—</p>

<p>
“The king doth wake to-night, and takes his rouse,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Keeps wassel.”</span><br />
</p>

<p>The meetings indeed were themselves called after them—</p>

<p>
“He is wit’s peddler, and retails his wares<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">At wakes and wassels, meetings, markets, fairs.”</span><br />
</p>

<p>One of the earliest wassail songs is that introduced by Dissimulation,
disguised as a religious person, in Bale’s old play
of Kynge Johan, about the middle of the sixteenth century.
He brings in the cup by which the king is poisoned, stating
that it “passith malmesaye, capryck, tyre, or ypocras,” and
then sings—</p>

<p>
“Wassayle, wassayle out of the mylke payle,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Wassayle, wassayle as white as my nayle,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Wassayle, wassayle in snowe, froste, and hayle,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Wassayle, wassayle with partriche and rayle,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Wassayle, wassayle that muche doth avayle,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Wassayle, wassayle that never wylle fayle.”</span><br />
</p>

<p>In Caxton’s Chronicle the account of the death of King
John represents the cup to have been filled with good ale; and
the monk bearing it, knelt down, saying, “Syr, wassayll for
euer the dayes so all lyf dronke ye of so good a cuppe.”</p>

<p>The loving-cup, at city and other feasts, may be considered
as an offshoot of the wassail-bowl, drinc-heil being converted
into drink-all. In after times the term became applied almost
exclusively to Christmas, perhaps from wassailing being more
common at that period, and there was a custom in many places
of carrying the bowl round, generally by young women, from
door to door, with an appropriate song, the bearer expecting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
a small gift in return. Selden, in his ‘Table Talk,’ alluding to
this custom, says, “The Pope, in sending relics to princes,
does as wenches do by their wassails at New Year’s tide, they
present you with a cup, and you must drink of a slabby stuff;
but the meaning is, you must give them moneys ten times
more than it is worth.”</p>

<p>The days generally chosen for the wassail bowl were Christmas
Eve, New Year’s Eve or Twelfth Night, which in some
places was called Wassail eve. Machyn, in his Diary, mentions
his being at supper at Mrs. Lentall’s, at Henley-on-Thames,
on Twelfth Eve, 1556, when there came in “xij
wessells with maydens syngyng with their wessells, and after
cam the cheyff wyffes syngyng with their wessells; and the
gentyll-woman had hordenyd a grett tabull of bankett, dyssys
of spyssys and frut, as marmelad, gynbred, gele, comfett,
suger plat, and dyver odur.” Master Machyn is somewhat
arbitrary in his spelling, even allowing for the eccentricities
in this art at the time in which he wrote.</p>

<p>In the seventeenth century the wassail bowl was carried
round to the houses of the gentry and others, the bearers
expecting a gratuity:—</p>

<p>
“Good dame, here at your door<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Our wassel we begin;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">We are all maidens poor,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">We pray now let us in</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6.5em;">With our wassel.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Our wassel we do fill</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">With apples and with spice,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Then grant us your good will</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">To taste here once or twice</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6.5em;">Of our good wassel.“</span><br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>The custom is still partially extant. Many great houses had,
and no doubt still have, wassail bowls of massive silver.
Wassail, in Ben Jonson’s mask of Christmas, is described
as a neat sempster and songster; her page bearing a brown
bowl, dressed with ribbons and rosemary, before her.</p>

<p>The practice of introducing the bowl is still retained in
Christmas meetings, though the component parts are generally
ale, sugar, nutmeg, and a toast, omitting the roasted apples,
which are necessary to constitute genuine lamb’s wool; “lay
a crab in the fire to roast for lamb’s wool;” in olden times
indeed the apple was almost an inseparable ingredient.—</p>

<p>
“....sometimes lurk I in a gossip’s bowl,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">In very likeness of a roasted crab;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And, when she drinks, against her lips I bob,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And on her wither’d dew-lap pour the ale.”</span><br />
</p>

<p>There are several old wassail songs still existing, as well as
some that bear a more modern stamp. In Devonshire, and
elsewhere, it is an old custom to wassail the apple and pear
trees, by pouring out a libation at the foot, in order that they
may bear the better.</p>

<p>
“Wassaile the trees, that they may beare<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">You many a plumb, and many a peare;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">For more or less fruits they will bring,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">As you doe give them wassailing.”</span><br />
</p>

<p>From what we read of the character of Henry the Seventh,
we cannot fancy him entering into these amusements with
unrestrained hilarity, but to have treated them as part of the
state ceremonies, counting the necessary cost with reluctance.
All the forms to be adopted for each day were laid down in
exact manner, and no doubt the time and quantity of smiles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
and laughter were properly regulated. Even his jokes were
somewhat of a severe practical kind; he once asked an astrologer
if he knew where he, the astrologer, should pass his
Christmas, and on his professing his ignorance, told him that
he was then the most skilled of the two, as he knew the astrologer
would pass it in the Tower, and sent him there accordingly,
and then we may suppose ate his Christmas dinner
with much self-satisfaction. The custom of giving Christmas-boxes
and New Year’s Gifts, seems now to have been organised
into a regular system; there was a graduated scale for
giving and receiving, according to the rank of the parties,
and the amount was as well ascertained as the <i>quiddam honorarium</i>
to a barrister or a physician.</p>

<p>At New Year’s Day in the morning, an usher of the chamber
came to the door of the king’s chamber, and said, “There
is a New Year’s Gift come from the queen,” to which the
king answered, “Sir, let it come in;” the usher with the gift
was then admitted, and afterwards the ushers with gifts from
the nobles, according to their rank, and these messengers had
rewards given them, from ten marks to the queen’s messenger,
if a knight, down to forty shillings to an earl and countess’s
servant. The queen received gifts in the same manner, though
of less value. The king was on this day to wear his kirtle,
his surcoat, and his pane of arms, with his hat of estate, and
his sword borne before him. No doubt an accurate list was
kept of those expected to give their New Year’s Gifts, and as
their messengers arrived they were marked off; or, if they
failed in their duty, were looked on with suspicion and ill will.
In one year he gave away as much as £120 in New Year’s
Gifts, but this was probably in return for presents of much
larger amount, or in reward to those bringing gifts; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
whole must have been a sadly formal proceeding, and more to
the glorification of man than any other purpose.</p>

<p>On Christmas Day and the other feast days, the queen
made her offerings, amounting generally to five shillings in
each case, and also gave away money in alms, charges being
made for sixty shillings for this purpose on New Year’s Eve.
She also gave numerous sums at Christmas, in gifts; as, to
the grooms and pages of the household £20; to the lord of
Misrule 20<i>s.</i>; to my lord privy seal’s fool 3<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i></p>

<p>Cards were much used, as in former times, and sums of a
hundred shillings are charged for the queen’s “disporte at
cardes.” The lord, or abbot, of Misrule, as he was indiscriminately
called, was now an important officer, and an
essential accompaniment to the Christmas revels; payments
are frequently made to him, generally of ten marks or
£6. 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> Under these or some other similar names
this personage existed from very early times, not only at
court, but in the houses of the nobility, of the lord-mayor
and sheriffs, in the Inns of Court, and at the different
colleges; he is even mentioned in the original draft of
statutes, of Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1546, soon after
which time he appears to have reached the summit of his
magnificence. Many of the nobility kept the feast with great
splendour, and probably during the time of Henry the Seventh,
exceeded even the court in this respect. They had their own
players, minstrels, and waits, and officers of their household,
in imitation of the royal establishment; having among their
retainers many gentlemen and frequently some knights.</p>

<p>Edward Stafford, duke of Buckingham, gave some princely
entertainments during this reign; on the Epiphany, 1508, he
had 459, to dinner, of different degrees, including 134 gentry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
with two minstrels, six trumpets, four waits, and four players.
The supply of provisions was fully commensurate with the
demand, but it would not afford much interest to give it
in detail; as unusual dishes now, may be mentioned a salt
sturgeon, three swans, two peacocks, two herons, four dog fish,
and half a fresh conger; oysters were probably scarce, as only
200 are mentioned, valued at 4<i>d.</i>; the wines were Gascony,
Malvoisy, Rhenish, and Ossey, besides 259 flaggons (gallons)
and one quart of ale; there were also two gallons of furmity,
a dish which has continued in use to the present time. On the
previous Christmas Day, the guests being fewer in number,
the consumption of ale was only 171 flaggons and one quart,
of which seventeen flaggons and three quarts were for breakfast;
but this was not far from the time when the maids of
honour had a chet loaf, a manchet, a gallon of ale, and a
chine of beef for breakfast.</p>

<p>Swans were standard dishes formerly at great houses at
Christmas, and other great festivals; Chaucer’s monk, no
doubt a good judge,</p>

<p>
“A fat swan loved he best of any rost.”<br />
</p>

<p>In the Northumberland Household Book, five are directed
for Christmas Day, three for New Year’s Day, and four for
Twelfth Day. Except in the state of a cygnet, and that rarely,
the bird now is not met with at table.</p>

<p>The humbler classes of society also had their rejoicings at
this tide, and were allowed certain privileges and facilities for
the purpose, the restrictions under which artificers, labourers,
and servants were placed as to not playing at cards and certain
other games being suspended during Christmas, when there
was, among other sports, playing at cards for counters, nails,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
and points, in every house; but, as Stow says, more for
pastime than for gain. The holidays, according to this
annalist, extended from All-Hallows Evening to the day
after Candlemas Day, and there was a penalty attached to
any householder allowing such games, except during this
time. Dramatic performances were exhibited at the houses
of the great and wealthy, where the tenants and peasantry
were allowed access, and cheered with good Christmas hospitality;
carol singing was encouraged, and it is not improbable
that some of our modern carols may be connected
with this age, though somewhat modified.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-w.jpg" width="130" height="137" alt="W" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capi3">WHEN Henry the Eighth came to the throne the
festivities at Christmas, as well as those at other
seasons, were kept with great splendour. He was
then young, of manly address, and tall handsome
person, skilled in martial exercises, of great
bodily strength and activity, and accomplished; fond of exhibiting
his prowess; and, though naturally overbearing, possessed
some chivalrous qualities in the early part of his reign, until freed
from the advice of Wolsey, and spoiled by flattery and adulation,
and the unrestrained indulgence of his passions; for, as the
cardinal said of him in his dying state, “he is a prince of
most royal courage; rather than miss any part of his will, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
will endanger one half of his kingdom.” Had he not been so
unfortunate as to rule in what was then a despotic monarchy,
he might have passed through life as an impetuous, convivial,
somewhat overbearing person, rather keeping his family in
fear, but not much worse than characters we all now and then
meet with in society, who bully their wives, children, servants,
and clerks, bluster at committee meetings, and are somewhat
troublesome members of clubs. As the case was, however,
he presents a memorable example of the effects of uncontrolled
selfishness, pride, and passion.</p>

<p>Plays, masques, pageants, and similar diversions were frequent
and splendid during this reign, or rather during the
first half of it; for after Henry became interested in the
reformed religion, and encumbered with the succession of his
wives, and also grew unwieldy in shape, and unfitted for
personally partaking in their amusements, they gradually fell
off, both in magnificence and in frequency, till they nearly
ceased altogether. In his younger days he was generally a
performer, and a skilful one, in those pastimes; and numerous
entries may be found of payments of every description connected
with Christmas—such as for disguisings, lord of Misrule,
New Year’s gifts, Christmas-boxes, &amp;c. In his first year
he kept it at Richmond with great royalty, and although there
had not been time to arrange such a pageant or masque as we
shall find in after-times, yet the lord of Misrule, whose payment,
in the time of Henry the Seventh, never exceeded
£6 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>, was paid £8 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>, which was afterwards increased
to £15 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> The lord of Misrule, in the first and
several of the following years, was William Wynnesberry, who
also appears in his father’s reign: other persons named in this
office are, Richard Pole, Edmund Travore, and William Tolly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>Sir Walter Scott gives a humorous account (except to the
sufferer) of the ill usage of an apparitor, or macer, of the see
of St. Andrew, in 1547. He was sent with letters of excommunication
against Lord Borthwick, and, unluckily for him,
chose the time when the inmates of his castle were engaged
in the revels of the Abbot of Unreason, as this festive ruler
was called in Scotland. The unfortunate apparitor was of
course looked on as an alien enemy, or an outlaw, or any other
terrible thing, and was immediately seized and well ducked;
after which he was compelled to eat the parchment letters of
excommunication, which had been previously steeped in a
bowl of wine, and then to drink off the wine. In the play
of Sir John Oldcastle, a similar incident is introduced, but the
sumner of the Bishop of Rochester, who is the sufferer there,
and has to eat the waxen seal also, is told that “tough wax is
the purest of the honey.”</p>

<p>In 1545, Sir Thomas Cawarden, who died 1560, was
appointed master of the revels. In the same year payments
were made to Robert Amadas, for plate of gold stuff for the
disguising, of £451 12<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i>; and to William Buttry, for silk
for the same purpose, of £133 7<i>s.</i> 5<i>d.</i>; so that, taking the
difference of value of money into account, Henry began his
reign with a determination to spare no expense in his entertainments,
and subsequently the charges were much increased.
In his second year the Christmas was kept at Richmond, and
on the Twelfth Day we have a specimen of the pageants afterwards
so much in fashion, though rather wild perhaps for our
present tastes. This was devised like a mountain, glittering,
as if with gold, and set with stones, on the top of which was
a tree of gold, spreading out on every side with roses and
pomegranates; it was brought towards the king, when out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
came a lady, dressed in cloth of gold, and the henchmen, or
children of honour, who were dressed in some disguise, and
they danced a morris before the king; after which they
re-entered the mountain, which was drawn back, and then the
wassail or banquet was brought in, and so ended the Christmas.
These pageants must have been managed something like the
pantomime or melo-dramatic devices we see on our own stage,
and produced perhaps as much effect, taking into account the
increase of modern fancy and expectation in this respect.</p>

<div class="caption">PAGEANT BEFORE HENRY THE EIGHTH.</div>
</div>

<p>In his third year, at Greenwich, there was a magnificent
Christmas, with such abundance of viands for all comers
of any honest behaviour, as had been seldom seen; and
the invention of the devisers of pageants was taxed to the
utmost, and dancing-masters were doubtless in request for the
rehearsals; the clever Mr. Flexmore would have been invaluable.
On New Year’s Night, there was erected in the
hall, a castle, with gates, towers, and dungeon, garnished
with artillery, and other warlike weapons of the most approved
form; and in the front of it was written its name, “<i>Le
Fortresse dangerus</i>,” that is evidently, dangerous from the
ladies’ eyes, and not from the warlike preparations. For in
this castle were six fair ladies, no doubt selected for their
grace and beauty, all clothed in russet satin, laid over with
leaves of gold, and each hood knit with laces of blue silk and
gold; and coifs and caps of gold on their heads. From the
abundance of gold on these occasions, we could almost imagine
that some “diggins” must have been known then. Well,
after this castle, with the golden damsels in it, had been
drawn about the hall, and the queen had seen it, (for Henry
really was attached to her for the first few years of his reign,)
in came the king with five select companions, dressed in coats,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
of which half was of velvet satin, with spangles of gold, the
other half of rich cloth of gold, having on their heads caps of
russet satin, embroidered with fine gold bullion. These
gallant knights vigorously assaulted the castle, and the
ladies seeing them so courageous, capitulated with them, and
yielded it up, after which they came down and danced
together for some time, when the ladies in their turn became
the conquerors, and took the knights into the castle, which
suddenly vanished out of sight; by which we must assume,
not that they all vanished into the air, but that they were
drawn out of the hall as fast as the living, and probably concealed
machinery used for the purpose, could make away with
them. The sports of this Christmas, however, were not yet
at an end; for on the night of the Epiphany, the king and
eleven chosen companions were disguised after the manner of
Italy, called a mask, a thing not before seen in England; they
were dressed in long and broad garments, wrought with gold,
and had visors and caps of gold; and after the banquet they
came in with six gentlemen, disguised in silk, bearing staff
torches, and desired the ladies to dance. Some of them were
content to do so, but others that knew the fashion of it
refused, because it was a thing not commonly seen, something
like the hesitation shown when the waltz, the polka, and other
strange matters, were first introduced here, the passion for
which, after a little time, made up for the shyness with which
they were at first admitted into good society.</p>

<p>These pageants must have been gorgeous affairs, as far as
dress and decorations, but would hardly suit the present
taste; the descriptions here given will enable any one inclined
(if any) to imitate them.</p>

<p>In the following year the Christmas was again kept at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
Greenwich, and on Twelfth Day a mount was introduced,
ornamented with flowers of silk, and full of slips of broom,
signifying Plantagenet; the branches being made of green
satin, and the flowers of flat gold of Damascus. On the top
was a goodly beacon giving light, round which sat the king
and five others, dressed in coats and caps of crimson velvet,
spangled and embroidered with gold. Four wodehouses (or
wild men) drew the mount towards the queen, and then the
king and his companions descended and danced; the mount
then suddenly opened, and out came six ladies, dressed
in crimson satin, embroidered with gold and pearls, and with
French hoods on their heads, and they danced by themselves
for a time; after which the lords and ladies danced together;
the ladies then re-entered the mount, which was conveyed out
of the hall, and then there was a very sumptuous banquet.</p>

<p>These French hoods were probably a new fashion, and as
fashions travelled into the country but slow in those times,
when there were neither electric telegraphs, railroads, stagecoaches,
newspapers, magazines, nor penny, nor, indeed, any
other postage, they do not seem to have got into Cornwall
much before the year 1550; for the wife of one of the
prisoners condemned to suffer for the riot at that time,
intending to go to beg his life, took so long to adjust her new
French hood to her taste, that her husband was hung before
she arrived. It is to be hoped that she was not taking this
course of revenging Henry’s injuries to the sex.</p>

<p>In the fifth year of this reign, Sir Harry Guildford, master
of the revels, immortalised his name by inventing an interlude,
in which was a moresco dance of six persons and two ladies.</p>

<p>In the sixth year, there was another grand Christmas; and
on Twelfth Night the pageant may be considered as a ballet of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
action, differing from some of modern times, simply in this:
that in ours professing to mean something, the meaning
cannot be discovered, while in these there was no meaning at
all. On New Year’s Night the king and the Duke of Suffolk,
his chivalrous brother-in-law, with two others, dressed in
mantles, hose, doublets, and coats of cloth of silver, lined
with blue velvet, the silver being pounsed, so that the velvet
might be seen through, led in four ladies in gowns, after the
fashion of Savoy, of blue velvet, lined with cloth of gold; and
mantles like tippets, knit together of silver; with bonnets of
burnished gold. They were accompanied by four torch-bearers,
in white and blue satin. The fanciful attire of the party
pleased much, especially the queen, into whose chamber they
went and danced, after which they put off their visors, and
made themselves known, when the queen heartily thanked
the king for her goodly pastime, and kissed him; finding it
necessary, in these early times, probably to flatter his vanity,
and keep him in good humour.</p>

<p>On Twelfth Night we have the ballet, though what we
should call now of limited interest. The king and the queen
came into the hall at Greenwich, where this Christmas was
kept, when suddenly a tent of cloth of gold entered; before
it stood four men-at-arms, armed at all points, with swords in
their hands, then, at the sound of trumpets, four more came
in, and a fierce, but bloodless, combat ensued, of four to four;
but before the victory could be awarded to either party, suddenly
(again) there came out of a place like a wood, eight
wild men, with ugly weapons and terrible visages, dressed in
green moss made of silk, green moss being the assumed substance
of which wild men make their apparel. These attacked
the knights, but after a terrific combat of eight to eight, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
driven out of the hall by the knights, who followed them.
After these warlike representations the tent opened, and six
ladies and six lords, richly apparelled, came out and danced;
after which they again entered the tent, which was conveyed
out of the hall; and then the king and queen were served
with a right sumptuous banquet, which, indeed, formed an
essential part of every entertainment.</p>

<p>There were payments made this Christmas to Leonard
Friscobald of £247 12<i>s.</i> 7<i>d.</i>, for velvets and silks for the disguising;
and to Richard Gybson, for certain apparel for the
same, of £137 14<i>s.</i> 0½<i>d.</i>; and, in after years, we find other
similar payments to this Gybson; so that trade benefited by
these amusements, which is a natural consequence.</p>

<p>In his seventh year Henry kept his Christmas at Eltham;
and in the fine old hall there, on Twelfth Night, a castle was
introduced, having in it ladies and knights dressed in braids
of gold, with moving spangles, silver and gilt, set in crimson
satin, and not fastened; the ladies’ heads and bodies being after
the fashion of Amsterdam. This castle was attacked by certain
vagrant knights, who were, however, repulsed after a severe
struggle. Dancing then of course took place; and afterwards
a banquet of 200 dishes, with great plenty to everybody.</p>

<p>In his eighth year, there was a grand Christmas at Greenwich;
and on Twelfth Night, the Queen of Scots also being
a visitor, an artificial garden was set up, called the Garden of
Espérance. This had towers at each corner, and was surmounted
with gilt rails, and the banks were all set with
artificial flowers of silk and gold, the leaves being of green
satin, “so that they seemed very flowers.” In the middle
was a pillar of antique work, all gold, and set with pearls and
stones, and on the top an arch crowned with gold, within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
which stood a bush of red and white roses of silk and gold,
and a bush of pomegranates of like materials. Of course
there were knights and ladies, richly apparelled, walking in this
garden; there were indeed six of each, who came down and
danced, and were afterwards conveyed out of the hall in the
garden, and the entertainments concluded as usual with a
great banquet. Our friend Richard Gybson had £130 19<i>s.</i> 0½<i>d.</i>
for divers things bought by him for this disguising.</p>

<p>In the following year, in consequence of the prevalence of
the sweating sickness from July to December, there was no
solemn Christmas kept at Court; but in several following
years it was kept much as before, and it will be needless to
multiply examples, especially as the pageants were in general
of a less marked description.</p>

<p>As, in nearly every year, there were payments made to sets
of players, the highest being in general £4 to the king’s old
players, who are distinguished from the king’s players, whose
fee was usually but £3 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>, it seems that during the
Christmas, on what may be called the off-nights, there were
some performances by them. The children also of the king’s
chapel gave their assistance, but their services were estimated
higher, as there are several payments of £6 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> to
Mr. Cornish, for playing before the king with them.</p>

<p>In his tenth year, also, the gentlemen of the king’s chapel
had £13 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> for their good attendance in Christmas, and
there are similar charges in subsequent years.</p>

<p>In the eleventh year there was another mask, and Richard
Gybson received £207 5<i>s.</i> 1½<i>d.</i> for the revels called “a
maskelyn” at New Hall, or Beaulieu, in Essex.</p>

<p>In the fourteenth year the Christmas was kept at Eltham,
where the Cardinal made many reformations in the royal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
household, and all that had no masters were sent away; in
modern phrase, no followers were allowed.</p>

<p>In the sixteenth year there were grand feats of arms, and
an assault made on a strong artificial fort at Greenwich,
where the king and the Duke of Suffolk distinguished themselves;
the whole concluding with masks and dancing.</p>

<p>In his seventeenth year—in consequence of the prevalence of
the plague according to historians, and partly perhaps because
he was now maturing his plans for the possession of Ann
Boleyn (who would not yield to him, as her sister Mary had
done), and for the divorce of Queen Catherine, though not
effected until long afterwards—the king kept his Christmas
quietly at Eltham, whence it was called the still Christmas.
Wolsey, however, would not follow his master’s example, and
kept a royal Christmas at Richmond, with plays and disguisings,
which gave much offence to see him keep an open
court, and the king a secret one.</p>

<p>In the following year, however, the king made up for this
intermission of revels, by keeping a solemn Christmas at
Greenwich, with revels, masks, disguisings, and banquets;
and there were justs kept on the 30th of December, and also
on the 3d of January, where 300 spears were broken. Afterwards
the king and fifteen others, in masking apparel, took
barge, and went to the Cardinal’s place, where was a great
company of lords and ladies at supper,—</p>

<p>
“..........having heard by fame<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Of this so noble and so fair assembly,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">This night to meet here, they could do no less,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Out of the great respect they bear to beauty.”</span><br />
</p>

<p>The maskers danced, after which the ladies plucked away
their visors, so that they were all known; and the sports were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
concluded with a great banquet. Previous to this time the
Christmas festivities at the Inns of Court had become celebrated,
and as we shall find, in subsequent reigns, surpassed
those of the court in fancy, and wit, and real splendour; nor
is this a matter of surprise when we consider the concentration
of talent that must always exist in these communities, some
fresh from the universities, embued with classic lore, though
in the age of which we are now writing perhaps somewhat
pedantic; others, fraught with the accumulated knowledge of
years, sharpened by the continual collision with intellects as
keen as their own; and few perhaps are better able to appreciate
true wit and humour than those who seek it as a
relief from deep and wearing mental labour, not that all hard
and plodding students can appreciate them, many are but
what we used to call at school, muzzes, <i>et præterea nihil</i>.</p>

<p>That the entertainments were somewhat stiff or pedantic
was of the spirit of the times, and yet there was a freedom in
dancing “round about the coal fire,” which would scarcely
suit the present day, though it would attract a considerable
number of spectators to see the barristers, dressed in their
best, singing and dancing, before the chancellor, judges, and
benchers, and that on penalty of being disbarred; a threat
absolutely held out, in the time of James the First, at
Lincoln’s Inn, because they did not dance on Candlemas
Day, according to the ancient order of the Society, and some
were indeed put out of commons by decimation. Imagine an
unfortunate suitor inquiring about a favourite counsel, who
had his case at his fingers’ ends, and being told he was disbarred,
because he had refused to dance the night before with
his opponent’s counsel; the benchers not having taken into
consideration the difficulty of a little man, as he was, polking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
with a fat barrister, gown, and wig, and all. Dugdale gives
the following programme of the performances at a date somewhat
later than that of which we are now speaking. “First,
the solemn revells (after dinner and the play ended,) are
begun by the whole house, judges, sergeants-at-law, benchers;
the <i>utter and inner barr</i>; and they led by the <i>master of the
revels</i>; and one of the gentlemen of the utter barr are chosen
to sing a song to the judges, sergeants, or masters of the
bench; which is usually performed; and in default thereof
there may be an amerciament. Then the judges and
benchers take their places, and sit down at the upper end
of the hall. Which done, the <i>utter barristers</i> and <i>inner barristers</i>
perform a second solemn revell before them. Which
ended, the <i>utter barristers</i> take their places and sit down.
Some of the gentlemen of the <i>inner barr</i> do present the house
with dancing, which is called the <i>post revels</i>, and continue
their dances till the judges or bench think meet to rise and
depart.” So that a barrister might be punished for not
singing, as well as not dancing. Whether he was obliged to
sing carols, or might choose his own song, such as, “Oh!
brief is my joy,” “Ye shall walk in silk attire, and siller ha’
to spend,” “Bid me discourse,” &amp;c., does not appear on
record. Lincoln’s Inn celebrated Christmas as early as the
time of Henry the Sixth, but the Temple and Gray’s Inn
afterwards disputed the palm with it, and indeed the latter on
some occasions seems to have surpassed the other Inns of
Court.</p>

<p>The first particular account of any regulations for conducting
one of these grand Christmasses, is in the ninth of Henry
the Eighth, when, besides the King for Christmas Day, the
marshal, and master of the revels, it is ordered that the King<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
of the Cockneys on Christmas Day should sit and have due
service, and that he and all his officers should use honest manner
and good order, without any waste or destruction making
in wines, brawn, chely, or other vitails; and also that he and
his marshal, butler, and constable-marshal should have their
lawful and honest commandments by delivery of the officers
of Christmas; and that the said King of Cockneys nor none of
his officers meddle neither in the buttery nor in the steward
of Christmas his office, upon pain of forty shillings for every
such meddling; and, lastly, “that Jack Straw and all his
adherents should be thenceforth utterly banisht, and no more
to be used in this house, upon pain to forfeit, for every time,
five pounds, to be levied on every fellow hapning to offend
against this rule.”</p>

<p>Who this Jack Straw was, and what his offences were, does
not appear, unless a kind of Wat Tyler against the peace and
dignity of the King of Cockneys. One of the leaders of Wat
Tyler’s insurrection, indeed, according to some accounts, the
next in command, assumed the name of Jack Straw, others
being called Wyl Wawe, Jack Shepherd, Tom Miller, and Hob
Carter; besides the celebrated priest, John Ball, who began
one of his sermons on Blackheath with</p>

<p>
“When Adam dolue and Evah span,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Who was then a gentle-man?”</span><br />
</p>

<p>But there was also a Jack Straw hung and quartered in the
eighth of Henry the Sixth.</p>

<p>In the eighteenth year of Henry, the Society of Gray’s Inn
got into a worse difficulty than paying allegiance to Jack
Straw, and that, too, in perfect innocence on their part; but
they had a play or disguising, which had been in great part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
devised by Serjeant John Roe twenty years before. The plot
was, that Lord Governance was ruled by Dissipation and
Negligence, by whose misgovernance and evil order, Lady
Public-weal was put from Governance, which caused <i>Rumor
populi</i>, Inward grudge, and Disdain of wanton sovreignetie to
rise with a great multitude to expel Negligence and Dissipation,
and restore Public-weal again to her estate. It was set
forth with rich and costly apparel, with masks and morescoes,
and was highly praised. But the proud Wolsey, who was
then busying himself about the intended divorce, fancied it
reflected on him, and sent in a great fury for the unlucky
serjeant, took his coif from him, and sent him to the Fleet
prison, together with one of the actors, Thomas Moyle of
Kent, who probably gained this unenviable distinction by
having excelled in the performance of the character intrusted
to him; all the actors were highly rebuked and threatened.
After a time the matter was satisfactorily explained, and the
captive revellers were liberated.</p>

<p>It was found prudent from time to time to make regulations
in respect to these revels, in order to limit the expenses, and,
if possible, to check the rivalry between the different societies,
and they were not therefore performed every year.</p>

<p>During the Christmas of 1529, Cardinal Wolsey, who had
been disgraced a short time before, was dangerously ill, which
produced a short return of favour with the selfish monarch,
who became much worried with his state, and also the unsettled
position of his own domestic arrangements; for although
it was supposed that Ann Boleyn was in fact living with him
as his queen, yet no divorce had taken place from Catherine,
who had still a strong party in her favour, and excited much
sympathy. However, for the king’s recreation, a solemn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
Christmas was kept at Greenwich, with justs, banquets, masks
and disguisings, attended by the two legates and many of the
nobility; but the queen gave them no manner of countenance,
her mind being so troubled. In the two following years she
kept the Christmas with him, and there were masks and interludes;
but in his twenty-third year, at a solemn Christmas at
Greenwich, there was no mirth, the queen and her ladies
being absent—like Queen Vashti she refused to come, and
no wonder, for in a very few days after her royal estate was
given unto another, and Henry publicly married Anne Boleyn.
After this time he does not appear himself to have mixed in
the Christmas festivities, though yearly entries may be found
of payments to players, for playing before him, and sometimes
to the gentlemen of the chapel, and the children as before,
with occasional notices of solemn Christmasses; but his
temper grew worse, and his zest for these amusements
gradually less, as his age and person increased.</p>

<p>In the Christmas of his twenty-ninth year, after the death
of Queen Jane in the previous October, he appeared in
mourning apparel, which was somewhat unnecessary, as he
had made an offer, although an unsuccessful one, to the
Duchess Dowager of Longueville, within a month after the
death of his wife. His Twelfth Day, 1540, was rather unlucky
for him; although great rejoicings were going forward, as he
then married Anne of Cleves, from whom, as it is known, he
was soon after divorced.</p>

<p>Card playing and other games were still continued, and
different payments were made on this account; the king, one
Christmas, having as much as £212 10<i>s.</i> for this purpose.
Payments were made also to Princess Mary to disport her
with at Christmas, generally £20, and in her own private<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
accounts are payments at Christmas, varying from £1 to £4,
to have in her purse and to play at cards. The Lady Anne
Boleyn received as much as £100 at a time, towards her New
Year’s Gift. The Princess Mary, from her childhood, had
an establishment of her own, and was accustomed to these
festivities before she had completed her sixth year, having
a lord of Misrule, John Thurgoode, one of the valets of her
household about this time; but the sanction of the great
cardinal was necessary even for her; and in 1525 there is an
application by the Council of her household to him, to know
whether they may appoint a lord of Misrule, and provide for
interludes, disguisings, or plays, and a banquet; and whether
the princess was to send New Year’s Gifts to the king and
queen, and the French queen, and of what value. The
princess herself had received New Year’s Gifts as early as her
third year, when the cardinal gave her a cup of gold; the
French queen, a pomander; Lady Mountjoy, two smocks;
a favourite gift by the bye, as we shall hereafter see that
Queen Elizabeth had many of these, handsomely decorated,
given to her. In after years we find at different times gifts
of the following nature given to the Princess Mary. Lady
Dorset and others gave her wrought smocks and handkerchiefs;
her brother the prince, a little tablet of gold;
the Princess Elizabeth, a little chain, and a pair of hose,
wrought in gold and silk; the Lady Margaret, a gown of
carnation satin of the Venice fashion; Lady Butler, a pepper-box,
silver-gilt; the Earl of Hertford, a diamond ring; three
Venetians, a fair steel glass; Mr. Thomas Hobbs, yeoman of
the robes, a pair of silver snuffers; Mrs. Whelar, a pen and
inkhorn, silver-gilt; the Italian dancer, a partlet of gold,
wrought; Lady Brown, a fuming-box of silver; and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
king’s master-cook, a marchpane; which was the usual
present of this functionary. All the servants who brought
these gifts had handsome presents in money in return, the
king’s messenger having as much as forty shillings given
him. Besides money gifts to her own household, and to the
king’s minstrels and musicians, among whom the harper had
5<i>s.</i>, she gave others of value in various Christmasses to distinguished
persons; as, in 1543, a chair to the king, of which
the covering and embroidery cost £21 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>; also, to the
lord admiral, a brooch of gold, of the history of Moses striking
water out of the rock, and a balas set in the same; she herself
having a brooch of the history of Noah’s flood, set with little
diamonds and rubies; the king, and the queen for the time
being, and the Prince Edward, as we may imagine, also received
gifts from his sisters; and on one occasion the Lady Elizabeth
gave him a cambric shirt of her own working. In the present
day it would probably have been a couvrette, or an embroidered
smoking cap, though he was rather young for that. His
times were innocent of this strange fashion, though they had
quite sufficient eccentricities of their own to answer for. It
is a pity that the recent act, compelling chimneys to consume
their own smoke, does not extend to smokers; it is almost
worth while mooting the point, whether it does or not.</p>

<p>The nobility kept the feast in manner similar to the court,
making allowance for difference of station. They had their
lord of Misrule, or master of the revels, and their minstrels,
their players, with their interludes and disguisings; the
chaplain being frequently the maker of the interludes; and
most minute rules were laid down to regulate the different
payments and gifts. The Earl of Northumberland, whose
household book has been so often quoted in illustration of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
manners and customs of this age, used to give, when he was
at home, to those of his chapel, if they played the play of the
Nativity on Christmas Day, 20<i>s.</i>; and to his master of the
revels, 20<i>s.</i>; to the king’s servant, bringing a New Year’s
gift, he gave £5, or if a special friend of his own, £6 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>;
to the queen’s servant, £3 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>; but to the servant (probably
a domestic), bringing one from Lord Percy, only 12<i>d.</i>; to his
three minstrels, on New Year’s Day, for playing at the chamber
doors of the different members of the family £1 3<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>; to
his six trumpets, 20<i>s.</i>; to his officer of arms, for crying
largess, 20<i>s.</i>; to the grooms of his chamber, to put in their
box, 20<i>s.</i>; to the abbot of Misrule, 20<i>s.</i>; to his chaplain for
making an interlude, the price seems to be 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>, rather
moderate when compared with the other gifts. Different
presents also to various sets of players; also 20<i>s.</i> each to the
barne-bishops (boy-bishops) of Beverley and York, showing
that the custom still existed.</p>

<p>Traces of the boy-bishop may be found as far back as the
Constantinopolitan synod in 867, and as early as Edward the
First’s reign, one of them was permitted to sing vespers before
him at Heton, near Newcastle, in 1299, when on his way to
Scotland, and received forty shillings for himself and the boys
who sang with him. In the time of Edward the Second payments
were made to this personage; and Dean Colet, in his
regulations for St. Paul’s School, 1512, directs the scholars to
go every Childermas Day to St. Paul’s to hear the child-bishop’s
sermon, and each to offer him a penny. Henry the
Eighth, however, put down the custom, which was revived by
Queen Mary, but finally abolished by Elizabeth.</p>

<p>The Earl of Northumberland’s three henchmen presented
him with gloves, and received 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> in return; and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
footmen also gave him gloves, and received 3<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> in reward.
My lord and lady were accustomed to make offerings at high
mass on Christmas Day, New Year’s Day, and Twelfth Day;
but of rather small amount, his lordship’s being 12<i>d.</i> and her
ladyship’s 8<i>d.</i> In lesser establishments there was, of course,
less state and smaller payments; and in the household accounts
of the Lestranges of Hunstanton, in the eleventh of Henry,
is a payment of 4<i>d.</i> to the Lord of Christmas, at Kyngstede.
Different sums also are charged for New Year’s gifts.</p>

<p>The lower classes still continued the customs of their forefathers,
but occasionally required some check, to prevent their
revelries becoming of too gross a description, and to amend
abuses. In the third of Henry the Eighth, people were
forbidden to appear abroad like mummers, their faces covered
with vizors, and in disguised apparel. But it was by no
means the intention to debar them from proper recreations
during this season; many indulgences being afforded them,
and their landlords and masters assisted them with the means
of enjoying their customary festivities, listening to their
legendary tales round the Yule-log, and occasionally joining
in their sports; a practice scarcely yet obsolete in some parts
of the country, and pity it should become so.</p>

<p>
“A Christmas gambol oft’ would cheer<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The poor man’s heart through half the year.”</span><br />
</p>

<p>In the thirty-third of Henry, when certain games were
forbidden to artificers, husbandmen, apprentices, servants, and
others of that class, they were still allowed to play at tables,
tennis, dice, cards, bowls, clash, coyting, and logating, at
Christmas; though there is a proclamation by the Sheriff
of York, where the privilege is extended beyond our ideas of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
liberality, as all manner of whores and thieves, dice-players,
carders, and all other unthrifty folk, were to be welcome in
the town, whether they came late or early, at the reverence of
the high feast of Yule, till the twelve days were passed. One
fancies a spice of irony in this invitation. Heywood, the
epigrammatist, at a little later date, used to say, that he did
not like to play at king and queen, but at Christmas, according
to the old order of England; and that few men played at
cards, but at Christmas; and then almost all, men and boys.
Heywood evidently had not been initiated into any of our
whist clubs, or he would have found not a few who play at
other times than Christmas. And as to that time, there are
still many houses where cards are regularly produced on
Christmas Day, a practice which, certainly, to those unaccustomed
to it, even the old order of England will not qualify.</p>

<p>There is a story told of an ambitious shoemaker, whose
Christmas coat was spoiled, in the reign of Henry, by his
seeking to imitate his superiors; and this at a time when the
distinction of apparel was marked, and not as at present,
when simplicity of dress is frequently the best mark of a
gentleman. Sir Philip Calthrop, having bought as much fine
French tawney cloth as would make him a gown, gave it to a
tailor, at Norwich, to make up, when John Drake, a shoemaker,
passing by, and admiring it, ordered one of the same
materials and fashion. Sir Philip, calling in on a subsequent
day, and seeing a similar gown-piece, asked for whom it was
made, when he was told it was for a shoemaker, and to be of
the same fashion as his own: upon which, his pride being
touched, he ordered the tailor to make his gown as full of
cuts as his shears would make it. The tailor fulfilled his
directions, and performed the same operation for the gown of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
the unfortunate shoemaker, who, by some accident, could not
go to fetch it away until Christmas morning, intending, no
doubt, to astonish his wife and dazzle his companions with
his splendour. On seeing the havoc made in his intended
state dress, he began to cry out vehemently, but was told it
was made exactly like the knight’s; upon which he exclaimed,
“By my latchet, I will never wear gentleman’s fashion again.”</p>

<p>Payments were made by Henry the Eighth to waits, at
Canterbury, as they were by Henry the Seventh, as well as
at other places. These, however, were not at Christmas time,
nor were they peculiar to Christmas, but formed part of the
musical establishments of the court and the nobility. Originally,
indeed, they do not seem of necessity to have been of
a musical class; or, at any rate, there were some who were
not so; as, in the time of Henry the Third, Simon le Wayte
held a virgate of land at Rockingham, in Northamptonshire,
on the tenure of being castle-wayte, or watch, and the same
custom was observed in other places. This Simon le Wayte
fled for theft, and was not the only suspected person of his
craft: for, at the time the treasury exchequer was broken
open and robbed, in the time of Edward the First, Gilbertus
le Wayte, who was keeper of the watch, was very naturally
taken up on suspicion, but it does not appear what was done
with him. After this the wait seems to have been a
musician, usually playing the pipe or hautboy, who kept
watch at night, and made <i>bon guet</i> at the different chamber
doors, particularly at Christmas time; and Edward the Fourth
had one attached to his establishment for this purpose. In
the old lay of Richard Cœur-de-Lion, there is notice of—</p>

<p>
“A wayte ther com in a kernel (<i>battlement</i>),<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And a pypyd a moot in a flagel” (<i>flageolet</i>).</span><br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>Among the minstrels in the household of Edward the
Third, there were three waits, who had 12<i>d.</i> a day in time
of war, and only 20<i>s.</i> a year in time of peace. Henry the
Sixth also had one in his household, and frequent mention is
made of them from his time to the end of Henry the Eighth,
and in subsequent reigns. In Charles the First’s band, of
fifty-eight, there were twenty-five for the waits; and, as is
well known, they exist to the present time; the regular wait
even exhibiting his regular appointment and badge, with the
portcullis, although waking people at most irregular hours,
and with most irregular tunes. The City of London had its
waits, who attended the Lord Mayor on public occasions,
such as Lord Mayor’s day, and on public feasts, and great
dinners. They are described as having blue gowns, red
sleeves and caps, every one having his silver collar about his
neck. Several other towns also had their own establishments
of waits, and there are many entries of payments made to
them by our kings, and other great personages; as, to the
waits of Canterbury, before mentioned, those of Colchester—as
far back as Edward the Fourth—Dover, Coventry, Northampton,
Newcastle, &amp;c.; and as they appear to have been on
the watch to catch any great person that came in their way,
they would seem to have handed down this part of their trade
to the bell-ringers of the present age, part of whose occupation
appears to be to get paid for not ringing. One of the
old towers in Newcastle was formerly called the wait’s tower,
and was the place of their meeting. There is a tradition of
their having played to Oliver Cromwell, on his route to or
from Scotland.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-a.jpg" width="120" height="120" alt="A" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capi2">ALTHOUGH in the short reign of Edward the
Sixth, the splendour of the royal Christmasses
was, in general, somewhat reduced, yet, in
1551-2, there was one of the most magnificent
revellings on record; for the youthful king being much grieved
at the condemnation of the Duke of Somerset, it was thought
expedient to divert his mind, by additional pastimes, at the
following Christmas. George Ferrers, of Lincoln’s Inn, being
a gentleman of some rank, was appointed lord of Misrule, or
master of the king’s pastimes, and acquitted himself so well
as to afford great delight to many, and some to the king, but
“not in proportion to his heaviness.” George Ferrers seems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
to have been well adapted for his responsible office; not only
being a gentleman, but a person of decision, and determined
to carry it through, with due spirit and display; and to see
that his officers, as well as himself, were well attended to.
He complained to the master of the revels, Sir Thomas
Cawarden, that the apparel provided for his counsellors was
not sufficient, or fit for the purpose, and no doubt had the
defect remedied; as, from the account of the expenses, the
dresses were handsome, and his own in particular may be
called superb. He also stated he should require John Smyth,
as his disard, or clown; besides jugglers, tumblers, and fools,
&amp;c.; and a new fool’s coat, with a hood, was made for Smyth,
what he had already not being fit for the purpose. The dress
of this clown, who was probably a well-known court fool,
from his being applied for by name, will show that no expense
was spared, even about the officers of this gallant lord of
Misrule. He had a long fool’s coat, of yellow cloth of gold,
all over fringed with white, red, and green velvet, containing
7½ yards, at £2 per yard, garded with plain yellow cloth of
gold, four yards, at 33<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> per yard; with a hood, and a pair
of buskins, of the same figured gold, containing 2½ yards, at
£5; and a girdle of yellow sarcenet, containing one quarter,
16<i>d.</i> The whole value being £26 14<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>, a goodly sum for
the dress of a jester.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<div class="caption">LORD OF MISRULE.</div>
</div>

<p>At the risk of being tedious, the various dresses of the
lord of Misrule himself must be mentioned, to give some
notion of the style in which this celebrated revelling was got
up. On Christmas Day, and during that week, he wore a
robe of white baudekyn (a rich stuff, made of silk, interwoven
with golden thread), containing nine yards, at 16<i>s.</i> a yard,
garded with embroidered cloth of gold, wrought in knots,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
fourteen yards, at 11<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> a yard; having a fur of red feathers,
with a cape of camlet thrum. A coat of flat silver, fine with works,
five yards at 50<i>s.</i>, with an embroidered gard of leaves of gold,
and silk, coloured, containing fifteen yards, at 20<i>s.</i> A cap of
maintenance, of red feathers and camlet thrum, very rich,
with a plume of feathers. A pair of hose, the breeches made
of a gard of cloth of gold, embroidered in panes; nine yards
of garding, at 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>, lined with silver sarcenet, one ell, at 8<i>s.</i>
A pair of buskins, of white baudekyn, one yard, at 16<i>s.</i>, besides
making and other charges, 8<i>s.</i> more. A pair of pantacles,
of Bruges satin, 3<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>; a girdle of yellow sarcenet, containing
a quarter of a yard, 16<i>s.</i> The whole cost being £52 8<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>,
independent of the cap of maintenance.</p>

<p>For the remaining dresses, it is unnecessary to state the
quantities and particular prices. He had, for New Year’s
Day, and that week, a robe of red baudekyn, with an
embroidered gard of purple silver; a coat of the same materials,
embroidered and garded in like manner; a pair of hose,
slopwise; the breeches of cloth of gold figured with red and
green velvet, with a cut gard of cloth of gold on it; and a
pair of buskins of red baudekyn; the cost being £34 15<i>s.</i> A
hunter’s coat, of cloth of gold, figured with red and green
velvet church-work, garded with a border of cloth of gold,
embroidered, lined with under sleeves of white baudekyn; a
hat of plain cloth of gold, garnished with leaves of green
satin. The cost £19 14<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> For Twelfth Day, and his
progress in London, he wore a robe of wrought purple furred
velvet, the inside white and black, like powdered ermine, with
a coat, a head-piece, and a scapular, of the same; the garment
welted above, with blue and yellow gold tinsel; the hat
garnished with purple velvet, striped with threads of silver;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
and an ell of white and blue taffeta, for laces for the same.
A pair of hose, the breeches of purple cloth of silver, welted
with purple tinsel and gold. A pair of buskins, striped
purple velvet, with threads of silver, £33 12<i>s.</i>; the above
sums being exclusive of workmanship, and other necessary
materials. These dresses, which were supplied from the king’s
stores, must have satisfied the cravings of the most finished
exquisite: and, taking into account that he was attended by
the following attendants of his court, besides Venus, who
formed part of the pageant, and that they were all handsomely
or appropriately dressed, it was enough to turn any moderate
man’s head. His suite was composed of his heir apparent,
who was John Smyth, before mentioned, three other sons,
and two natural sons (the sons being represented in handsome
fool’s dresses), counsellors, pages of honour, gentlemen
ushers, sergeant at arms, a provost marshal, under marshal,
lieutenant of ordnance, heralds for himself, others for Venus,
a trumpeter for himself, and another for Venus, an orator,
interpreter, a jailor, footmen, a messenger, an Irishman, an
Irishwoman, six hunters, jugglers, a fool for his lordship, and
one for Venus.</p>

<p>On the 4th of January, he went by water, from Greenwich
to London, and landed at the Tower wharf, attended by
a number of young knights and gentlemen, with trumpets,
bagpipes, and flutes, and a morris dance with a tabret. One
strange part of the procession, also, was a cart, with the
pillory, gibbet, and stocks. He then rode through Tower-street,
where he was received by Sergeant Vawee, the lord of
Misrule to John Mainard, one of the sheriffs of London, who
conducted him to the house of Sir George Barne, the lord
mayor, where there was a banquet: and, at his departure, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
lord mayor gave him a standing cup, with a cover of silver-gilt,
of the value of £10, for a reward. He also set a hogshead
of wine and a barrel of beer at his gate, for the train
that followed him.</p>

<p>The motto taken by Ferrers was, <i>semper ferians</i> (always
keeping holiday), and his crest was the holm-bush, or evergreen
holly. He had himself to incur considerable expenses,
independent of the assistance he received from the king’s
stores; but the honour qualified this, and, of course, men of
family and property were selected for the onerous office.</p>

<p>In the following year the revels were kept nearly in the
same manner; and, on this occasion, the king’s lord of
Misrule was graciously pleased to knight the sheriff’s lord of
Misrule; and they had a great banquet at my lord Treasurer’s.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the short reign of Edward, it was
enacted, that the Eves of Christmas Day, the Circumcision,
and the Epiphany, should be kept as fasts. But this was
repealed very early in the reign of Mary, who, about the same
time, issued a proclamation to prevent books, ballads, and
interludes, from touching on points of doctrine in religion;
and which, in effect, stopped all interludes and dramas, without
special license. Her short reign was not very congenial
to Christmas festivities, her own melancholy temperament,
and domestic disappointments, interfering with them at court;
but they were still kept up throughout the country, although
much checked by the persecutions on account of religion.
And what more fierce and rancorous than the persecution of
man by his fellow-man, of Christian by his so-called fellow
Christian, in the name of the All-merciful God; slaying and
torturing by fire and sword, for difference in the worship of
that Being, who abounds in pity and compassion for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
erring sinner! Proud, cold, vindictive man! it will be an
awful question to answer hereafter, “What hast thou done?
The voice of thy brother’s blood crieth unto me from the
ground.”</p>

<p>The Christmas masques were not, however, abandoned, and
in the first Christmas after the marriage of Philip and Mary,
there was one where the characters seem somewhat incongruous
with the disposition of Mary, as there were six Venuses,
or amorous ladies, with six cupids, and male and female
Turks, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Among the numerous miscellaneous New Year’s gifts presented
to Mary in 1556, were the fore part of a kyrtell, and a
pair of sleeves, of cloth of silver, richly embroidered all over
with Venice silver, and raised with silver and black silk, given
by the princess Elizabeth; a table, painted of the queen’s
marriage, by Suete, painter; a smock, wrought all over with
silk, and collar and ruffs of damask, gold, pearl, and silver, by
the Duchess of Somerset; six sugar loaves, six tapnetts of figs,
four barrels of suckets, and orange water, &amp;c., by Lady
Yorke, who, apparently, had a sweet tooth; two fat oxen, by
Mr. Michael Wentworth—in the present time we should have
taken them for granted, as prize oxen; two guinea-cocks,
scalded by Gent; a marchpane, and two dishes of jelly, by
Burrage, master cook; a fat goose and a capon, by Mrs. Preston;
a cake of spice bread, by Kelley, plasterer; nutmegs and
ginger, and a long stalk of cinnamon elect, in a box, by
Smalwodde, grocer; a basket of pomegranates, cherries,
apples, oranges, and lemons, by Harris, fruiterer; three rolls
of songs, by Sheparde, of the chapel; a fair lute, edged
with passamayne of gold and silk, by Browne, instrument
maker.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>The lord-mayor kept his state as usual, and in the end of
January, 1557, the lord treasurer’s lord of Misrule,—for this
officer’s power was frequently extended to Candlemas Day—came
to the lord-mayor with his suite, and invited him to dinner.</p>

<p>In the following year there is a notice of the lord of
Misrule, which would be rather strange if we did not know
that going to the Poultry Compter in those days was not
always a mark of disgrace or difficulty, as in recent times;
but after all allowance made, some part of the account is
suspicious; however, as we have not got the name of the
master reveller, we may give the story, that on New Year’s
Eve a lord of Misrule, with his herald, trumpets, and drums,
and several attendants, disguised in white, went to London,
and was brought to the Poultry Compter, and divers of his
men lay all night there, and they went astray home again,
by four and six together, to Westminster, on horseback and
on foot. It is to be hoped that those who came disguised in
white did not go home disguised in liquor; but let us give
them the benefit of the doubt.</p>

<p>Queen Elizabeth, who, to powerful intellect, joined much of
the arbitrary temper of her father, possessed also great vanity
and fondness of display. In her time, therefore, the festivities
were renewed with great pomp and show; and theatrical
entertainments were also particularly encouraged, and were
frequently performed before the queen, especially at Christmas
time. To restrain somewhat the great expenses of these entertainments,
she directed, in her second year, estimates to be
made of them previously; but this wholesome practice, judging
from the cost of after years, did not exist very long. In 1559,
which may be called her first Christmas, the play before her,
on Christmas Night, unluckily contained some offensive or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
indecent matter, as the players were commanded to leave off,
and the mask came in dancing. On the Twelfth Night
following there was a play, and then a goodly mask, and
afterwards a great banquet.</p>

<p>In 1561, a lord of Misrule, having with him a train of 100
horsemen, richly apparelled, rode through London to the
Inner Temple, where there was great revelling throughout
the Christmas; Lord Robert Dudley, afterwards Earl of
Leicester, being the constable and marshal, under the name
of Palaphilos; and Christopher Hatton, afterwards chancellor,
was master of the game. A sort of parliament had been previously
held on St. Thomas’s Eve to decide whether the
Society should keep Christmas; and if so, the oldest bencher
delivered a speech on the occasion, the oldest butler was to
publish the officers’ names, and then, “in token of joy and
good liking, the bench and company pass beneath the hearth,
and sing a carol, and so to boyer.” It was at this Temple
Grand Christmas that Ferrex and Porrex, which may be considered
as the first play assuming the character of the regular
tragedy, was performed. The revels at these Grand Christmasses
generally continued throughout the whole twelve days;
Christmas Day, New Year’s Day, and Twelfth Day, being
more particularly distinguished. On this occasion, at the
breakfast of Twelfth Day, were brawn, mustard, and malmsey;
the dinner of two courses to be served in the hall, and after
the first course came the master of the game, apparelled in
green velvet, and the ranger of the forest in green satin,
bearing a green bow with arrows, each of them having a
hunting horn about his neck; after blowing three blasts of
venery, they paced three times round the fire, which was then
placed in the middle of the hall. The master of the game<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
next made three courtesies and knelt down, and petitioned to
be admitted into the service of the lord of the feast. This
ceremony having been performed, a huntsman came into the
hall with a fox, and a purse-net with a cat, both bound at the
end of a staff, and nine or ten couple of hounds, the horns
blowing. The fox and cat were then set upon by the hounds,
and killed beneath the fire; a pleasant Christmas amusement.
This sport being finished, the marshal ushered all in their
proper places, and after the second course, the oldest of the
masters of the revels sang a song, with the assistance of
others present; after some repose and further revels, supper
of two courses was served, and when that was finished, the
marshal was borne in by four men, on a sort of scaffold or
framework, and taken three times round the hearth, crying
out, “A lord, a lord,” &amp;c.; after which he came down and
went to dance. The lord of Misrule then addressed himself
to the banquet,—the unfortunate fox and cat ought to have
formed part—which ended with minstrelsy, mirth, and
dancing; when they all departed to rest.</p>

<p>In 1573, there was some urgent expedition necessary in
getting the revels ready in time; for a set of unfortunate
plasterers were kept at work all night, and as they could not
be spared, nor trusted, to go abroad to supper, they were
allowed bread, and cheese, and beer, for that meal. The
queen generally had masks of different kinds before her at
Christmas time, of greater or less magnificence; but mention
must not be omitted of the celebrated Christmas at Gray’s
Inn, in 1594, of which an account was published under the
title of Gesta Grayorum. Mr. Henry Helmes, the Christmas
Prince, took for his style, “The High and Mighty Prince;
Henry, Prince of Purpoole; Arch-duke of Stapulia and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
Bernardia; Duke of High and Nether Holborn; Marquis of
St. Giles and Tottenham; Count Palatine of Bloomsbury and
Clerkenwell; Great Lord of the Cantons of Islington,
Kentish Town, Paddington, and Knightsbridge; Knight of
the most heroical Order of the Helmet; and sovereign of the
same.” According to our views, the entertainments would be
considered heavy and pedantic in their nature; but they were
in the style of the age, and seem to have given much satisfaction.
There was a cessation of sports from Twelfth Night
till the 1st of February, the prince being supposed absent in
Russia on public affairs. On that day he was received at
Blackwall, as if on his return, and that and the following day
were spent in revelling and feasting, which then ceased until
Shrovetide, when a mask was performed before the queen,
containing, as usual, some gross flattery, and she was so much
pleased with the performance, that on the courtiers dancing
a measure after it, she exclaimed, “What! shall we have
bread and cheese after a banquet.”</p>

<p>She was particularly partial to theatrical performances,
and throughout her reign frequent mention is made of the
plays performed during Christmas, at Court, and the rewards
given to the players; the children of St. Paul’s also, and the
scholars on her new foundation in Westminster, often performed
before her at this season.</p>

<p>In 1560 and several following years, Sebastian Westcott,
master of the children of St. Paul’s, received £6 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>, for
their services, which seems to have been the usual price paid
to regular players for a play, until the end of her reign,
when it was increased to £10. Richard Farrant, the master
of the children of Windsor, received for their services, in
1574, as much as £13 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1560, Sir Thomas Benger was made master of the
revels, succeeding Sir Thomas Cawarden; he dying in 1577,
Mr. Thomas Blagrave, who had acted since 1573, held the
office for a short time; but Mr. Edmund Tylney was appointed
in 1579, and died in 1610.</p>

<p>The play performed on Twelfth Night, 1571, was called
Narcissus, in which a live fox was let loose and chased by
dogs; so that the introduction of live animals on the stage is
not a modern invention. On New Year’s Day 1574, the
children of Westminster performed Truth, Faithfulness, and
Mercy. The scholars on the foundation at Westminster,
known as the queen’s scholars, have continued the custom of
acting plays to the present time, the performances having for
very many years past been one of Terence’s plays, of which
four are taken in rotation, and excellent acting is in general
exhibited to a select and talented audience; the concluding
ceremony of the cap, however, reminds one of the usual termination
of the country Christmas play of St. George. In the
beginning of this reign there are references to the custom,
then called an old one, of scholars being allowed, even by
their foundation deed, to bar out their masters a week before
Christmas and Easter.</p>

<p>At Christmas 1574, she had a company of Italian players,
amongst others, one of them was a tumbler. On New Year’s
Night 1582, there were also sundry feats of tumbling by the
servants of Lord Strange, besides plays during the Christmas,
and a mask of ladies. In several following years a tumbler,
called Symons, seems to have been famed for divers feats of
activity, and the queen apparently took pleasure in such exhibitions.
In 1600, a person, called Nycke, tumbled before
her, and 14<i>s.</i> are charged for his silk hose. In her latter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
years we find Edward Allen, John Heming, and Thomas
Pope, presenting plays before her. The rewards given to the
players, vary from £6 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> to £40. As the ‘Merry Wives
of Windsor,’ written at the queen’s request, and other of
Shakespeare’s plays, were performed at court, we may fairly
presume that some of them were performed at Christmas, and
that the great Bard himself may have acted before her.</p>

<p>In 1592, the vice-chancellor, and heads of colleges, at
Cambridge, were directed to act a comedy before the queen,
at Christmas; but these unfortunate victims of too much
learning were obliged to memorialize the vice-chamberlain,
stating their inability to act in English, and asking leave to
perform in Latin. They must have been in their glory in
the reign of Elizabeth’s successor, the pedant James, whom,
on one occasion, they addressed as Jacobissime Jacobe. Like
her predecessors, the queen would play at dice at Christmas
time, but she had dice set for her that threw the high numbers
only, as fives and sixes; and, as she knew not the trick,
she was kept in good humour by her success, as she, of course,
won; and her courtiers probably thought it worth some
sacrifice to avoid incurring the effects of the paternal temper
existing in her.</p>

<p>Kemp, in his celebrated morris-dance, from London to
Norwich, takes particular notice of the Norwich waits, saying
that few cities have the like, and none better; who, besides
their excellency in wind instruments, their rare cunning on
the viol and violin, had admirable voices, every one of them
being able to serve as a chorister in any cathedral church.
One Richard Reede, a wait of Cambridge, is particularly
mentioned, as having 20<i>s.</i> for his attendance at a gentleman’s
mansion, during the Christmas of 1574. Besides these,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
Puttenham speaks of tavern minstrels, that gave a fit of
mirth for a groat, much in the style of our present peripatetic
street musicians; their matter being for the most
part stories of old time, as the tale of Sir Topas, the exploits
of Bevis of Southampton, Guy of Warwick, Adam Bell, and
Clymm of the Clough, and such other old romances or historical
rhymes, made purposely for recreation of the common
people at Christmas dinners, and brideales, and in taverns,
and alehouses, and such other places of base resort.</p>

<p>The nobility, as in former times, imitated the court in the
manner of keeping Christmas, and the gentry followed in
their steps; but they were allured to town by the superior
festivities in the metropolis, to the neglect of their friends
and dependents in the country, besides dissipating their
means in London, and thus causing an inability to preserve
proper hospitality and charity in their own neighbourhood.
In order to check this practice, an order was
made in 1589, directing the gentlemen of Norfolk and
Suffolk to leave London before Christmas, and repair to
their own countries, there to keep hospitality among their
neighbours. Their presence also would not only enable
them to increase the real enjoyment of their dependents,
but would serve to controul any tendency to riot or debauch
at the country alehouses, at this time the resort of many
idle strollers, under the guise of minstrels, jugglers, revellers,
&amp;c., and would, if right-minded themselves, give a proper
direction to the festivities.</p>

<p>
“At Christmas be mery, and thanke god of all;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And feast thy pore neighbours, the great with the small.”</span><br />
</p>

<p>In 1581, there was a book written by Thomas Lovell,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
published by John Aldee, against the ‘Use and Abuse of
Dauncinge and Mynstralsye.’ It is of a puritanical nature,
being a supposed dialogue between Custom who defends
them, and Verity who attacks them and is made victorious.
Custom, however, pleads hard for dancing at Christmas time,
showing that it had been a usage of long standing.</p>

<p>
“Christmas is a mery time,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">good mirth therfore to make;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Young men and maids together may</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">their legs in daunces shake;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Wee se it with some gentlemen</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">a common use to be,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">At that time to provide to have</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">some pleasant minstrelsie.”</span><br />
</p>

<p>Towards the end of the Queen’s life, when she herself
failed in health and spirit, there was in general a great
abatement in Christmas festivities; the country taking the
tone from the monarch. In ‘Summer’s Last Will and
Testament,’ written about this time, Autumn talks of
Christmas, as—</p>

<p>
“..... a pinch-back, cut-throat churl,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">That keeps no open house, as he should do,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Delighteth in no game or fellowship,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Loves no good deeds and hateth talk;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">But sitteth in a corner turning crabs,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Or coughing o’er a warmed pot of ale;”</span><br />
</p>

<p>and in ‘Father Hubbard’s Tales,’ by Middleton, the Ant’s
Tale, referring probably to the time about the end of this
reign, and showing the nature of the amusements in vogue
at Christmas, the writer says, “Do but imagine now what
a sad Christmas we all kept in the country, without either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
carols, wassail-bowls, dancing of Sellenger’s round in moon-shine
about maypoles, shoeing the mare, hoodman-blind,
hot-cockles, or any of our old Christmas gambols; no, not
so much as choosing king and queen on Twelfth Night.”</p>

<p>With Elizabeth’s fondness for luxury and dress, and her
passion for adulation, it may well be imagined that her New
Year’s Gifts were rigidly expected, or exacted, from all classes
connected with her; from Matthew Parker, Archbishop of
Canterbury, down to Smyth the dustman; and they were
of a most miscellaneous description. In the preceding reigns,
when she was princess, she was in the habit of giving and
receiving them, but in a comparatively quiet and unobtrusive
manner, frequently consisting of presents of gilt plate, and
the messengers with gifts to her always receiving rewards;
but on one occasion she gave her brother, King Edward, a
translation in Latin, in her own hand, of an Italian sermon
of Occhini; her pride of scholarship even then showing itself.
There are many instances of authors giving compositions of
their own as New Year’s Gifts, and of books being printed
with that name, no doubt by way of attracting at this season.
On New Year’s Day, 1561, Nowell, Dean of St. Paul’s, who
preached before the queen on that day, got much blamed by
her, for having laid on her cushion, as a New Year’s Gift,
a prayer-book richly bound, having several fine cuts and
pictures of the stories of saints and martyrs; for she considered
these as being contrary to the proclamation against
images, pictures, and Romish relics in churches, and desired
such mistake might never occur again. One can fancy the
venerable Dean shrinking under the stern rebuke of the
peremptory young lady on a point of ecclesiastical discipline.
In return for the gifts presented to her, she generally gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
articles of gilt plate, as cups, bowls, salts, &amp;c., varying
according to the rank of the person; from 400 ounces to Sir
Christopher Hatton, to two ounces to Mrs. Tomysen, the
dwarf; and also presents of money to the servants. It
would be useless to insert a long list of these gifts, a few
will show the variety, the value and taste of some, and the
strangeness, according to our ideas, of others.</p>

<div class="caption">QUEEN ELIZABETH’S NEW YEARS GIFTS.</div>
</div>

<p>In 1560, she had a pair of silk stockings given her by
Mrs. Montagu, her silk-woman, which by some are said to
have been the first pair worn in England; however, they
became common soon afterwards. It may be mentioned, as
an act of kindness, that in this year she gave sixty French
crowns, as a New Year’s Gift, to —— Penne, widow, who
had been formerly nurse to King Edward. In the following
year she received presents in money from £40 by the Archbishop
of Canterbury, in a red silk purse in demy sovereigns,
to £4 by Lady Cheeke, in a russet silk purse; also various
articles of dress, most of them richly wrought, among which
were smocks worked in silk; and standing collars and partelets
wrought with gold, silver, and silk; and miscellaneous
articles, from handsome pieces of jewellery, down to one pye
of quinces, by John Betts, servant of the pastry, who received
two gilt spoons in return. In subsequent years the gifts are
much of the same nature, and a few only need be particularised.
Some may be considered as partaking of a professional
character: her doctors generally giving a pot of orange blossoms
and a pot of ginger, or something similar; and her
apothecary a box of lozenges, or a pot of conserves; while her
cook gave a marchpane, made into some kind of device; and
her serjeant of the pastry, a quince pie, and sometimes a pie
of quinces and wardens gilt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1574, the favourite, Earl of Leicester, gave her a splendid
fan, that ladies now might envy, being of white feathers, set
in a handle of gold; one side of it garnished with two very
fair emeralds, one of them especially fine, and garnished with
diamonds and rubies; and the other side garnished with
diamonds and rubies; and on each side a white bear and two
pearls hanging, a lion rampant with a white muzzled bear at
his foot. Handsomely wrought smocks are frequently mentioned.
This article, as is well known, was different from that
in present wear, the ornamental part could be safely exhibited,
and gentlemen could present them without breach of decorum;
though in our present fastidious days, a New Year’s Gift to a
lady of a chemisette, berthe, or gilêt, might be considered as
a somewhat eccentric <i>gage d’amour</i>.</p>

<p>In 1578, Philip Sidney gave a cambric smock, which may
be considered as quite in the florid or decorated style of workmanship;
the sleeves and collar being wrought with black
work, and edged with a small bone lace of gold and silver;
and a suite of ruffs cutwork, flourished with gold and silver,
and set with spangles. In the same year, Sir Gawen Carew
gave one worked with Venice gold, and edged with a small
bone lace of Venice gold; Smyth, the dustman, gave two
bolts of cambric; her doctors and apothecary, pots of ginger
and candy; and Mark Anthony, a violl.</p>

<p>In the following year, Morrys Watkins, whoever he might
be, gave eighteen larks in a cage, and received 20<i>s.</i> in reward.
In several years there are handsome gowns, petticoats, kirtles,
doblets, and mantles, some embroidered with precious stones,
bracelets, and other ornaments; so that it does not appear so
very surprising that at her death, Elizabeth left a hoard of
2000 dresses behind her. It must be presumed, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
that she was not in the habit of giving away any of her
apparel, or her ladies’ maids would have had rich perquisites.</p>

<p>In 1582, Lady Howard gave her a jewel of gold, representing
a cat and mice playing with her, garnished with small
diamonds and pearls; typifying perhaps the queen and her
maids; and she received from eight maskers a flower of gold,
garnished with sparks of diamonds, rubies, and opals, with an
agate of her majesty’s “phisnamy,” and a pearl pendant,
with devices painted in it.</p>

<p>In 1589, she had a jewel of gold, like an alpha and omega,
whatever that might be, garnished with sparks of diamonds.
Sir Francis Drake also gave her a fan of white and red
feathers, the handle of gold, enamelled with a half moon of
mother of pearl, within that a half moon garnished with
sparks of diamonds, and a few seed pearls on one side, having
her majesty’s picture within it, and on the other side a device
with a crow over it. Lord North, in his Household Book,
charges £40, as his New Year’s Gift to the queen, and
£16 10<i>s.</i> given at court at New Year’s tide. It need scarcely
be observed that the custom of New Year’s Gifts was prevalent
among all classes, and many examples might be given of
payments on account of them in the domestic records of the
age.</p>

<p>The customs in France about this time were very similar
to ours. In Sully’s ‘Memoirs,’ 1606, it is stated, “Les
cérémonies du jour de l’an, des rois et jours suivans, se passèrent
à l’accoustumée, en présens, festins, banquets, balets,
mascarades, courses de bague, et autres réjouissances et magnificences,
le roy, la reine, et la reine Marguerite vous ayant
envoyé vos estrennes, et à madame vostre femme aussi.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-p.jpg" width="126" height="125" alt="P" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capi2">PLAYS and other Christmas festivities continued
throughout the reign of James the First; and
amongst others we find ‘Measure for Measure,’
and the ‘Plaie of Errors,’ by Shaxberd—a new
reading as to the spelling of the name of our glorious bard—also
‘King Lear,’ and ‘Love’s Labour’s Lost.’ Many of
Fletcher’s plays likewise were first acted before the court
at Christmas.</p>

<p>Masks were performed almost yearly; and in one of
them, the ‘Queen’s Mask of Moors,’ the queen with eleven
ladies of honour took parts. Ben Jonson himself wrote
several for the court, and Inigo Jones assisted in the scenery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
and decorations. James performed one good act, by inflicting
a penalty of £10 on any one making use, in plays, shows, or
pageants, jestingly or profanely, of the Holy Name of God, or
of our Saviour, or of the Holy Ghost, or of the Trinity.</p>

<p>At the very commencement of this reign, John Hemynges
and his company received £53 for performing six interludes
or plays; and on the 8th of January, 1604, the queen and
her ladies presented a mask, by Samuel Daniell, called the
‘Vision of the Twelve Goddesses.’ In the following year,
Hemynges and his company received £60, for the same
number of plays, and £10 a play seems to have been the
usual reward. At the same time, the queen and her ladies
performed Ben Jonson’s mask of ‘Blackness,’ being the first
in which he was employed. It was got up in a magnificent
style, having cost the exchequer £3000. After the
performance, there was a banquet in the great-chamber,
which was so furiously assailed by the hungry guests, that
the table and trestles went down before one bit was touched.</p>

<p>There are some strange stories of scenes of excessive conviviality
in this reign, particularly during the visit of the
Danish king, Christian the Fourth, in 1606, when, on one
occasion, during the personation of the mask of ‘Solomon,
and the Queen of Sheba’—the King of Denmark being the
Solomon of the night—the representative of the Queen of
Sheba had imprudently imbibed too much of the nectar that
she was to have offered to Solomon, and stumbling, distributed
her classic offerings of wine, jelly, and cakes, over
his dress. He in his turn, attempting to dance, found it
necessary to fall, and cling to the floor, until taken off to bed.</p>

<p>
“<i>Cassio.</i> Is your Englishman so exquisite in his drinking?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;"><i>Iago.</i> Why, he drinks you with facility, your Dane dead drunk.”</span><br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>Some ladies, representing Faith, Hope, Charity, Victory,
and Peace, who were assumed to have been the attendants of
the Queen of Sheba, on her celebrated visit, sympathised with
their mistress, and were obliged, with proper assistance to
guide their tottering limbs, to retire for a time in a state of
maudlin sensibility.</p>

<p>From Gervase Markham’s account, in his ‘English Housewife,’
of a moderate dinner of this time, we may somewhat
judge of the prevalent profusion:—The first course should
consist of “sixteen full dishes; that is, dishes of meat that
are of substance, and not empty, or for show—as thus, for
example; first, a shield of brawn, with mustard; secondly, a
boyl’d capon; thirdly, a boyl’d piece of beef; fourthly, a
chine of beef, rosted; fifthly, a neat’s tongue, rosted;
sixthly, a pig, rosted; seventhly, chewets baked; eighthly,
a goose, rosted; ninthly, a swan, rosted; tenthly, a turkey,
rosted; the eleventh, a haunch of venison, rosted; the
twelfth, a pasty of venison; the thirteenth, a kid, with a
pudding in the belly; the fourteenth, an olive-pye; the
fifteenth, a couple of capons; the sixteenth, a custard, or
dowsets. Now, to these full dishes may be added, sallets,
fricases, quelque choses, and devised paste, as many dishes
more, which make the full service no less than two and thirty
dishes; which is as much as can conveniently stand on one
table, and in one mess. And after this manner you may
proportion both your second and third courses, holding
fulness on one half of the dishes, and show in the other;
which will be both frugal in the splendour, contentment
to the guest, and much pleasure and delight to the
beholder.”</p>

<p>If this was a frugal—a sort of friendly—dinner, what must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
have been a state one—of the Belgravian or East Indian class,
for instance?</p>

<p>On Twelfth Night, 1606, the mask of ‘Hymen,’ by Ben
Jonson, was performed, in honour of the unfortunate marriage
of Robert, Earl of Essex, with Lady Frances, daughter of the
Earl of Suffolk, afterwards so well known as the vicious wife
of the equally vicious favourite, Somerset. In the following
year was the mask of ‘Beauty,’ in which the queen and her
ladies took part; but, though intended for Twelfth Night, it
was not performed, for some reason, until Sunday, the 14th
of January, Sunday being by no means an unusual day for
these festivities. The following Christmas was dull and heavy,
like the weather; still there were plays at court.</p>

<p>On the 1st of January, 1611, Prince Henry, accompanied
by twelve other persons of rank, performed the mask of
‘Oberon,’ of which the expenses were £1092 6<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i> , including
£16 paid to Inigo Jones, for his labour; it being the
joint production of him and Ben Jonson, and contained a
variety of delicate music. It was performed in the new and
beautiful banquetting-house, at Whitehall. There were, likewise,
two other masks, by Ben Jonson and Inigo Jones, in
the same Christmas, which cost the queen £600. In one of
them, called, ‘Love freed from Ignorance and Folly’—the
name of the other being ‘Love Restored’—there were twelve
she-fools introduced, dressed in coloured taffeta, lined with
fustian, who performed a dance, and received each £1 for
her trouble. In November, 1612, Prince Henry died; a
prince who, according to most accounts, was much loved, and
from whose early promise much was expected. Whether his
father much mourned him seems a doubtful question: it has
been surmised that he was jealous of his popularity. At all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
events the following Christmas was kept with the usual festivities,
and his daughter Elizabeth was affianced to the
Palatine.</p>

<p>On the 26th of December, 1613, the favourite, Somerset,
was married to the Countess of Essex, at Whitehall, in the
presence of the King, Queen, and Prince Charles, and many of
the nobility, and several entertainments were given in the
course of the Christmas, to the well-matched pair. On the
4th of January, they went to a grand entertainment, at
Merchant Tailors’ Hall, and, after supper, were entertained
with a wassail, two pleasant masks, and dancing. On
Twelfth Day the gentlemen of Gray’s Inn invited them to a
mask—the ‘Mask of Flowers’—but they did not consent
willingly to this act, evidently considering it a degradation,
their repugnance having been overcome by Lord Bacon. It
appears to have been performed at the banquetting-house.</p>

<p>In 1616, Ben Jonson presented the well-known mask,
called the ‘Mask of Christmas,’ the principal characters being
Christmas and his children, Misrule, Carol, Minced-Pie,
Gambol, Post and Pair, New Year’s Gift, Mumming, Wassel,
Offering, and Baby-Cake. Prince Charles performed, and
obtained great applause in his mask, called ‘The Vision of
Delight, or Prince’s Mask,’ represented on Twelfth Night,
1618, when the Muscovy ambassadors were feasted at court,
and a sum of £750 was issued for the occasion. A mask
of ladies had been prepared for the same Christmas, and
many rehearsals had taken place, but for some reason it was
forbidden by the king and queen; to the great disappointment
of the ladies, no doubt.</p>

<p>The Inns of Court continued their revels as in former
reigns. Sir Simon D’Ewes complains of some great irregularities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
at the Temple, in 1620, and some subsequent years,
arising from gambling and quarrelling. In Christmas, 1622-3,
the Society of the Middle Temple incurred the displeasure of
the king—who apparently cared little for any one but
himself—by a demonstration in favour of his amiable and
talented daughter, Elizabeth of Bohemia. The lieutenant of
the Middle Temple had thirty of the best gentlemen of the
society to sup with him; during the meal, he took a cup of
wine in one hand, and his drawn sword in the other, and
drank a health to the distressed Lady Elizabeth, after which
he kissed his sword, and swore to live and die in her service,
and then passed the cup and sword round.</p>

<p>On the Twelfth Day in the same Christmas, a ludicrous
scene occurred, for at dead of night, the gentlemen of Gray’s
Inn, in order to make an end of their Christmas, shot off all
the chambers they had borrowed from the Tower, which were
as many as filled four carts. The king, who, as is well known,
could not bear the sight of a naked sword, being awakened
with the noise, started out of bed, crying out, “Treason!
treason!” The city was in confusion, and the court in arms,
the Earl of Arundel running to the king’s bed-chamber, with
his sword drawn, to rescue his sovereign.</p>

<p>In 1607, there was a celebrated exhibition of the Christmas
Prince, at St. John’s College, Oxford, conducted with more
than usual pomp. A numerous court was appointed, and
pageants and dramatic performances were from time to time
exhibited; the “Prince,” Mr. Thomas Tucker, continuing in
his office until Shrove Tuesday. There were some disturbances,
in consequence of the inability of many people to
find room, but probably not more than occur now occasionally
at the Commemoration. Sir John Finett, who was master of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
the ceremonies to James the First and Charles the First, and
who seems to have considered the settlement of points of
etiquette as the very essence of good government, in his
quaint publication, called ‘Philoxenis,’ gives many curious
particulars of disputes, in several years, both in this reign and
the following one, between the royal ambassadors; and claims
of precedence, and fanciful privileges on the part of themselves
and their wives; and of his own skill and finesse in arranging
them, so as in general to give satisfaction, and prevent the
peace of Europe from being disturbed, which, from his statement,
but for his diplomatic powers, would appear to have
been inevitable, had one ambassador’s wife got a back to her
chair, while another only had an ottoman. On New Year’s
Night, for instance, the intended mask was obliged to be
postponed, in consequence of some scruple on these formal
matters, of the French ambassador, but Sir John happily
overcame this before Twelfth Day, when the mask was
proceeded with, and the French, Venetian, and Savoyard
ambassadors were present. In the following year the prince
was a principal actor in the mask, and the French ambassador
took umbrage, because the Spanish ambassador was
invited. This schism was beyond Sir John Finett’s controul;
a correspondence ensued, but the French ambassador was
recalled before his time had expired. Many of the disputes
remind one of the points of etiquette respecting the old French
court privilege of the tabouret—as to wearing a cocked hat
fore and aft, as it is called, or athwart the head—as to wearing
a hat always in a club-room, or in the House of Commons,
if a member—as to the number of yards to a peeress’ train—as
to the feather in the cap of a Highland chief or chieftain—as
to the persons entitled to wear long-tailed wigs, or short-tailed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
wigs, or wigs with a curly tail—and many other equally
important points. However, etiquette is probably necessary
for the good rule of society, and high and low have their own
regulations. We find, in the East, it is considered a highly
aristocratic privilege, on ceremonial occasions, that the
palanquin should be borne crossways, instead of lengthways,
probably because it has a greater chance of being in the way;
but it is thought of so much importance, that a few years
since, Sri Sunkur Bharti, and Sidha Lingayah Charanti,
whoever those grandees might have been, contested the point
by appeal to the privy council.</p>

<p>The practice of giving New Year’s Gifts and Christmas
Boxes remained as before; the value of the gifts to the king
having become quite a matter of regulation. An earl, for
instance, was to buy a new purse of about 5<i>s.</i> price, and put
in it twenty pieces of 20<i>s.</i> value each, and go to the presence
chamber on New Year’s Day, about eight in the morning,
and give them to the lord chamberlain; then to go to the
jewel house for a ticket to receive 18<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> as a gift, and give
6<i>d.</i> there for a box for the ticket; then to go to Sir Wm.
Veall’s office, and receive the 18<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; then to the jewel
house again, and choose a piece of plate of about thirty
ounces weight, and mark it, and fetch it away in the afternoon,
give the gentleman that delivered it to him 40<i>s.</i> in
gold, and to the box 2<i>s.</i> and to the porter 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p>On New Year’s Day, 1604, the young prince, then in his
tenth year, gave his father as his gift, a short Latin poem, in
hexameter verse, which no doubt delighted the king. In
1610, he gave his sister, for his New Year’s Gift, a cabinet of
ivory, wrought with silver; five years before this, when she
was eight years of age, she had received from the corporation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
of Coventry a pair of fat oxen, as their gift at this season;
certainly a very substantial mark of respect, but a sort of
<i>bon-bon</i> that would somewhat astonish the royal nursery at
present.</p>

<p>The New Year’s Gifts, given by the Prince Palatine in
1612, when he married the Princess Elizabeth, were of a
sumptuous description, but may be considered more in the
light of marriage presents than New Year’s Gifts. The
jewels, he gave to his mistress alone, were valued at £35,000,
comprising a rich chain of diamonds, with pendant diamonds
for the ears; and two pearls scarcely to be equalled for size
and beauty. To each of her attendants he gave £100; and
to her chief usher, £150; to Mrs. Dudley, a chain of pearls
and diamonds, worth £500; to Lord and Lady Harrington,
golden and gilt plate of the value of £2000; to the prince, a
rapier and pair of spurs set with diamonds; and handsome
presents to the king and queen. There was great splendour
in dress at this wedding; the Lady Wotton had a gown that
cost £50 a yard; and Lord Montacute spent £15,000 in
apparel for his two daughters. Our ladies (independent of
jewels) would have some difficulty to match this at present;
but there was great extravagance of dress, in general, in the
course of this reign. Even Archie Armstrong, the well-known
court-jester, had, on the occasion of this marriage, a
coat of crimson velvet and gold lace, yellow worsted hose, and
crimson garters.</p>

<p>As specimens of the gifts presented in private life, we find
Sir Francis Bacon sending to the lady and daughters of
Sir M. Hicks some carnation stockings, with a request that
they would wear them for his sake. This would be considered
a strange sort of keepsake from a gentleman to a lady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
at present; but, as the Queen of Spain, in the former days of
Spanish etiquette, was said to have no legs; so, from the long
dresses now worn, it does not appear to signify much, except
as a matter of personal convenience to themselves, whether
our ladies have legs or not.</p>

<p>Turkeys and capons were Christmas presents during this
age, as the former are still: Justice Greedy says,—</p>

<p>
“...... I remember thy wife brought me,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Last New Year’s tide, a couple of fat turkeys.”</span><br />
</p>

<p>The goose was the more ancient dish than the turkey,
which was not introduced into England until the sixteenth
century, and the goose is still the favourite bird in Paris and
other parts of France, as it also is in the west and some other
parts of England. Indeed the Norfolk people may fairly be
suspected of having introduced the turkey as the Christmas
bird, when we find that several tons weight of them are sent
to London from that county annually at this season, some
individual birds weighing at least a quarter of a hundred. In
Spain patients used to present their medical attendants with
turkeys; so that men in large practice had to establish a little
trade in them. These turkeys were driven by gipseys from
parts of Old Castile, chiefly from Salamanca; the march was
about 400 miles, and lasted about half a year, so that the
birds left the farmer in the state of chickenhood, but arrived
almost at the maturity of turkeyhood on the journey.</p>

<p>There was a good deal of gambling at court during Christmas,
in the course of this reign, no one being admitted that
brought less than £300. In one night, Montgomery, who
played the king’s money, won for him £750, which he had
for his trouble; Lord Monteagle lost for the queen £400,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
and Sir Robert Cary for the prince, £300. The following may
give some notion of the manner of keeping Christmas, by an
English gentleman, at this time, as mentioned in Armin’s
‘Nest of Ninnies.’ “At a Christmas time, when good logs
furnish the hall fire, when brawne is in season, and indeed all
reveling is regarded, this gallant knight kept open house for
all commers, where beefe, beere, and bread was no niggard.
Amongst all the pleasures provided, a noyse of minstrells and
a Lincolnshire bagpipe was prepared; the minstrells for the
great chamber, the bagpipe for the hall; the minstrells to
serve up the knight’s meate, and the bagpipe for the common
dauncing.”</p>

<p>The Christmas-block or Yule-log, above referred to, is of
very ancient date.</p>

<p>
“Heap on more wood—the wind is chill;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">But let it whistle as it will,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">We’ll keep our Christmas merry still.”</span><br />
</p>

<p>A massive piece of wood was selected, frequently the rugged
root of a tree grotesquely marked, which was brought into the
great hall or kitchen, with rejoicing and merriment. The
old Christmas gambol of drawing Dun out of the mire—which
is referred to as far back as the ‘Towneley Mysteries,’ “Bot
if this draght be welle drawen Don is in the myre,”—was
probably connected originally with drawing in the Christmas
block.</p>

<p>
“If thou art Dun we’ll draw thee from the mire,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Of this (save reverence) love, wherein thou stick’st</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Up to the ears.”</span><br />
</p>

<p>A log of wood is brought in, which is called Dun the cart-horse,
and is supposed to stick in the mire. Some of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
party then advance and try to extricate him, but they require
more assistance; this continues till all are engaged, and Dun
is at length drawn out, “I see I’m born still to draw Dun out
o’ th’ mire for you.” Much fun arises from the feigned
awkwardness of the revellers, and contrivances to drop the log
on each other’s toes. Herrick says—</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">“Come, bring with a noise,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">My merrie merrie boyes,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The Christmas log to the firing;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">While my good dame, she</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Bids ye all be free,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And drinke to your heart’s desiring.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">With the last yeere’s brand</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Light the new block, and</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">For good success in his spending,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">On your psalteries play,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">That sweet luck may</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Come while the log is a teending,“</span><br />
</p>

<p>Formerly, each of the family sat down on the log in turn,
sang a Yule song, and drank to a merry Christmas and happy
New Year: after which they had, as part of their feast, Yule
dough, or Yule cakes, on which were impressed the figure of
the infant Jesus, and sometimes they were made in the shape
of a little image, studded with currants and baked, and the
bakers gave them as presents to their customers. Bowls of
frumenty, made from wheat cakes or creed wheat, boiled in
milk, with sugar and nutmeg, &amp;c., also made part of the feast.
Nor was the wassail bowl, or the tankard of spiced ale, omitted,
but formed a prominent part of the entertainment; Christmas
ale being generally of superlative merit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>Horace brings out his log and his best wine, as some of his
winter comforts.</p>

<p>
“Dissolve frigus, ligna super foco<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Large reponens; atque benignius</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Deprome quadrimum Sabina,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">O Thaliarche merum diota,”</span><br />
</p>

<p>and in the same ode, refers to pastimes similar to some of
ours at Christmas,—</p>

<p>
“Nunc et latentis proditor intimo<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Gratus puellæ risus ab angulo,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Pignusque dereptum lacertis,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Aut digito male pertinaci.”</span><br />
</p>

<p>Christmas candles of large size, frequently presents from
the chandlers, were at the same time used in some places;
and, when tired of the sports, the party gathered round the
log, and sang carols, or told legendary tales. The Essex logs
appear to have been in repute, “We shall have some Essex
logs yet to keep Christmas with,” says a character in one of
Middleton’s plays; and there were sometimes services reserved
to furnish these Christmas logs; as the cellarist of
St. Edmundsbury, for instance, held Hardwick under the
Abbey, and was bound annually to provide four Christmas
stocks, each of eight feet in length. The strangest log on
record, however, is that mentioned by Froissart, at a great
feast held by the Count de Foix. After dinner he went up
into a gallery, to which there was an ascent of twenty-four
steps; it being cold, he complained that the fire was not large
enough, on which a person named Ernauton d’Espaign, having
seen below several asses laden with wood, went down and
brought up-stairs on his back one of the largest, with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
load of wood, and threw him on the fire, feet upwards, to the
delight of the count and the astonishment of all; and of the
poor ass, no doubt, more than all.</p>

<p>A small portion of the log was to be carefully preserved to
light that of the following year; and on the last day of its
being in use, which, in some places, was on Candlemas Day,
a small piece having been kept on purpose, the custom
was to—</p>

<p>
“Kindle the Christmas brand, and then<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Till sunne-set let it burne;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Which quencht, then lay it up agen,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Till Christmas next returne.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Part must be kept, wherewith to teend</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">The Christmas log next yeare;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And where ’tis safely kept, the fiend</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Can do no mischiefe there.“</span><br />
</p>

<p>The Souche de Noël, in some places on the Continent, was
very similar to our log.</p>

<p>As to minstrels, the waits of Southwark, according to the
Citizen in the ‘Knight of the Burning Pestle,’ were as rare
fellows as any in England, and two shillings would bring them
all o’er the water with a vengeance, as if they were mad. In
the commencement of the following reign a character in a
play by Shirley introduces the city waits in a speech that,
with one slight alteration, is applicable to the present panic
felt by many persons respecting the possibility of foreign
invasion: “We will have the city waites down with us,
and a noise of trumpets; we can have drums in the country,
and the train-band, and then let the [French] come an they
dare.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>Burton, in his ‘Anatomy of Melancholy,’ mentions “The
ordinary recreations which we have in winter, and in most
solitary times busie our minds with, are <i>cardes</i>, <i>tables</i>, and
<i>dice</i>, <i>shovelboard</i>, <i>chesse-play</i>, the philosopher’s game, small
trunkes, shuttle-cocke, billiards, musicke, masks, singing,
dancing, ulegames, frolicks, jests, riddles, catches, purposes,
questions and commands, merry tales of errant knights,
queenes, lovers, lords, ladies, giants, dwarfes, theeves, cheaters,
witches, fayries, goblins, friers,” &amp;c.</p>

<p>After the accession of Charles the First, Christmas was
frequently observed with great splendour, and a variety of
plays, masks, and pageants, in which the king and queen,
with some of the courtiers, occasionally took part, until about
the year 1641, when the civil disturbances interfered with
all social enjoyments, and the spirit of fanaticism even
endeavoured to abolish any commemoration of the Nativity
of our Saviour. The king had his mask on Twelfth Day,
and the queen hers on the Shrovetide following, and considerable
sums were granted for the expenses, often exceeding
£2000.</p>

<p>The Christmas of 1632-3 was dull; the queen, having some
little infirmity, the bile or some such thing, kept in, and there
was but one play and no dancing; the gambling however
remained as before, the king carrying away £1850, of which
the queen took half. On Twelfth Night however she feasted
the king at Somerset House, and presented a pastoral, in
which she herself took part, and which, with other masks,
cost considerably more than £2000.</p>

<p>In the following year there were no masks, but ‘Cymbeline’
was acted before the court, and well liked. Prynne, in his
‘Histriomastix,’ having been supposed to reflect on the queen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
for her love of these diversions, was severely punished, as is
well known.</p>

<p>In the Christmas of 1641-2 only one play was acted, being
on Twelfth Day, at the cockpit in Whitehall; but the king
and queen were in no mood to be present, as the king on the
previous day had paid his eventful visit to the House of Commons
to demand the five members: and after this time he
had matter of too much moment to engage his attention to
allow of any further indulgence in festivities or amusement,
thenceforth, alas! unknown to him. The struggle then began
on the part of the Puritans to abolish Christmas as a festival
altogether. The first ordinances to suppress the performance
of plays were issued in 1642, and doubt began to be expressed
as to the proper manner of keeping this feast: in Christmas
1643, some in the city opened their shops, but they were shut
again, people being afraid of any popish observance, as they
called it, of the day. On one occasion, 1644, Christmas Day
was kept as a fast, as it fell on the last Wednesday of the
month, which was the day appointed by parliament for a
monthly fast, and it was ordered that this should not be an
exception.</p>

<p>Ministers were prohibited from preaching God’s word on
the Nativity, and were imprisoned if they attempted to do so;
and in 1647 the parish officers of St. Margaret’s, Westminster,
were committed and fined for allowing some of them to preach
on Christmas Day, and for adorning the Church with rosemary
and bays.</p>

<p>On the 3d of June in that year, the parliament abolished
the observance of Christmas and many other holidays, directing
that, instead of them, all scholars, apprentices, and servants
should, with leave of their masters, have a holiday on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
second Tuesday in every month. On this being proclaimed
at Canterbury, just previous to the ensuing Christmas, and the
mayor directing a market to be kept on that day, a serious
disturbance took place, wherein many were severely hurt.</p>

<p>On the 24th of December, 1652, the observance of Christmas
Day was strongly prohibited, and several entries may be
found in Evelyn’s Memoirs, in that and subsequent years, to
the effect that no service was allowed in the churches on that
day, so that it was kept at home or privately by the right-minded,
who occasionally got into difficulty in consequence.
Evelyn with his wife and others, while taking the sacrament
on Christmas Day, 1657, were taken into custody for breach
of the ordinance of the parliament, but were let off. In a
satirical list of supposed works called ‘Bibliotheca Parliamenti,’
1653, is ‘An Act for the speedy suppressing all Plays, the
Fools being all turned Commanders or Parliament men.’ Even
in the midst of fanaticism, however, Christmas festivities could
not be entirely abolished; and in the ‘Vindication of Christmas,’
old Father Christmas, complaining of his treatment for
the last twelve years, says, “But welcome, or not welcome,
I am come;” and says his best welcome was with some Devonshire
farmers, thus describing his entertainment:—“After
dinner we arose from the boord, and sate by the fire, where
the harth was imbrodered all over with roasted apples, piping
hot, expecting a bole of ale for a cooler, which immediately
was transformed into warm lambwool. After which we discoursed
merily, without either prophaness or obscenity; some
went to cards: others sang carols and pleasant songs (suitable
to the times); then the poor labouring hinds, and maid-servants,
with the plow-boys, went nimbly to dancing; the
poor toyling wretches being glad of my company, because they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
had little or no sport at all till I came amongst them; and
therefore they skipped and leaped for joy, singing a carol to
the tune of hey,</p>

<p>
‘Let’s dance and sing, and make good chear,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For Christmas comes but once a year;</span><br />
Draw hogsheads dry, let flagons fly,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For now the bells shall ring;</span><br />
Whilst we endeavour to make good<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The title ’gainst a king.’</span><br />
</p>

<p>Thus, at active games and gambols of hot cockles, shoeing
the wild mare, and the like harmless sports, some part of the
tedious night was spent; and early in the morning, I took my
leave of them, promising they should have my presence again
the next 25th of December, 1653.“</p>

<p>Herrick, in his ‘New Year’s Gift’ sent to Sir Simeon
Steward, sings—</p>

<p>
“Of Christmas sports, the wassel boule,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">That tost up after fox-i-th’-hole;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Of blind-man-buffe, and of the care</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">That young men have to shooe the mare;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Of Twelf-tide cakes, of pease and beanes,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Wherewith ye make those merry sceanes,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">When as ye chuse your king and queen,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And cry out, ‘Hey for our town green.’”</span><br />
</p>

<p>The noblemen and gentry were, in the early part of the
reign, directed to return to their mansion-houses in the
country, to keep up hospitality during the Christmas; and
many of them lived like petty princes, their household establishments
forming almost a mimic court. The Christmas
feast was kept up, the poor man’s heart was cheered by
earthly comforts, and he was led to the contemplation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
the eternal blessings bestowed on man at this tide. The
great hall resounded with the mirth of the servants, and
tenants, and other dependents, whose gambols amused the
lord of the mansion, and his family, and friends; and their
presence and participation in the festivities, together with
the shows exhibited by them, of which the poorer class were
frequently allowed to be the amused spectators, encouraged
them, and mitigated the trials and privations of the winter.</p>

<p>A splendid Christmas, held by Richard Evelyn, Esq., High
Sheriff of Surrey and Sussex, in 1634, at Wotton, may be
taken as an example. A lord of Misrule was appointed; in
this case, Owen Flood, gentleman, trumpeter to Mr. Evelyn,
was chosen, and regulations were made to support his authority;
amongst others, that if any man should kiss any maid, widow,
or wife, except to bid welcome or farewell, without his lordship’s
consent, he should have punishment as his lordship
should think convenient; it is to be presumed, however, that
the misletoe bough was a privileged place, a sort of kissing
sanctuary. The hall of the mansion being open on these
occasions, many gifts were made to assist in provisioning the
guests, and, at this time, the contributions were, two sides of
venison, two half brawns, three pigs, ninety capons, five geese,
six turkeys, four rabbits, eight partridges, two pullets, five
sugar-loaves, half a pound of nutmegs, one basket of apples
and eggs, three baskets of apples, and two baskets of pears.</p>

<p>The Christmas festivities, at some of the colleges, and at
the Inns of Court, were continued in this reign. In 1627-8,
there was a collision between Mr. Palmer, lord of Misrule of
the Temple, and the lord-mayor and city authorities. The
Temple lord chose to claim rents of 5<i>s.</i> a piece from the
houses in Ram Alley and Fleet Street, and broke open doors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
to enforce it, if not quietly opened. The lord-mayor went
with his watch to meet him, and after some scuffle, Mr. Palmer
was wounded and taken prisoner, and sent to the Compter,
and, after two nights, was released, by the intercession of the
attorney-general, on payment of all damages, and restoring
the rents.</p>

<p>In the ninth of Charles, the Inns of Court spent £2400
about their Christmas celebration, and the king was so
pleased with it, that he asked 120 of the members to a mask
at Whitehall, on the following Shrove Tuesday.</p>

<p>There was also a splendid Christmas at the Middle Temple,
in 1635, when Mr. Francis Vivian, of Cornwall, who had been
fined in the Star Chamber, about three years before, in respect
of a castle he held in that county, was the Christmas Prince,
and expended £2000 out of his own pocket, beyond the
allowance of the Society, in order to support his state with
sufficient dignity. He had his lord keeper, lord treasurer,
eight white staves, captain of pensioners and his guard, and
two chaplains, who, when they preached before him, saluted
him on ascending the pulpit with three low bows, as was then
done to the king. The lord-mayor and sheriffs supplied him
with wine, and Lord Holland, his justice in Eyre, with venison.
These descriptions really make us regret the cessation of such
festivities.</p>

<p>In December, 1641, Evelyn was elected one of the comptrollers
of the Middle Temple revellers, the Christmas being
kept with great solemnity; but he got excused from serving.
The most magnificent entertainment, however, given by the
Inns of Court, was on Candlemas Day, 1633—which day was
frequently distinguished by a farewell Christmas entertainment,
and the rule of the Christmas Prince extended to it—when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
the two Temples, Lincoln’s Inn and Gray’s Inn, jointly
presented Shirley’s ‘Triumph of Peace,’ at an expense to the
Societies of more than £20,000. The music, under the superintendence
of William Lawes and Simon Ives, cost £1000,
and the dresses of the horsemen were valued at £10,000.
Whitelocke and Hyde were two of the principal managers,
and the former wrote for it his celebrated ‘Coranto.’ The
king was so much entertained, that he requested it to be performed
again a few days afterwards at Merchant Tailors’ Hall.
Whether Gray’s Inn was more or less inclined to play than
the other Inns is not very material; but the following order,
in the fourth of Charles, may be taken either way, “that all
playing at dice, cards, or otherwise, in the hall, buttry, or
butler’s chamber, should be thenceforth barred, and forbidden
at all times of the year, the twenty days in Christmas only
excepted.” The Inner Temple, not to be outdone in propriety,
ordered, in 1632, that no play should be continued
after twelve at night, not even on Christmas Eve.</p>

<p>New Year’s Gifts were given as in former reigns; even little
Jeffery Hudson gave the queen in 1638, ‘The New Year’s
Gift,’ written by Microphilus, meaning himself. The Duke
of Buckingham, who was regardless of expense, appears to
have given £20 to the celebrated Archie, the king’s jester;
and £13 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> to the king’s fool, meaning his other court
fool, probably David Dromon. There is a story told of
Archie, who having fooled many was fooled himself; and
perhaps by this very nobleman. Archie went to him, or to
the nobleman whoever he was, to bid him good morrow on
New Year’s Day, and received twenty pieces of gold as his
New Year’s Gift; but covetously desiring more, shook them
in his hand, and said they were too light. The donor said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
“I prithee, Archie, let me see them again, for there is one
among them I would be loth to part with.” Archie unsuspectingly
returned them, expecting them to be increased; but
the nobleman put them in his pocket, with this remark, “I
once gave money into a fool’s hand, who had not the wit to
keep it.” The story of his having stolen a sheep, and hid it in
a cradle, has been mentioned before, but is probably spurious.</p>

<p>This Archie, or Archibald Armstrong, may be considered
as the last of the regular or official court fools; for Killigrew,
in the succeeding reign, although a licensed wit, was of a
higher class, both by birth and education; and Pepys’s
account of his having a fee for cap and bells was apparently
meant as a joke. The last play, in which the regular fool
was introduced, was probably, ‘The Woman Captain,’ by
Shadwell, 1680. Tarleton, in the preceding century, was
a celebrated performer in these characters.</p>

<p>A strange appendage this officer or attendant was to royal
and noble establishments; known even in oriental courts;
and continued from the time of the Anglo-Saxons, or perhaps
of the ancient Britons, to the time of which we are now
writing. They often became such favourites as to gain great
influence with their royal and noble masters, and frequently
possessed more wit and discretion than the so-called or self-called
sages, who endeavoured to make them their laughing
stock, but whose attempts frequently flew back, like the
boomerang, on their own heads. They differed of course
much in merit, from the fellow of infinite jest to the mere
practical joker, or the half-witted butt for the gibes of others.
Will Somers was a recognised favourite of the capricious
Henry the Eighth, and appears to have been a man of good
conduct; two or three portraits of him may be still seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
among the royal pictures at Hampton Court. It would be
out of place to give any anecdotes of these characters here,
or we might begin with Goles, the domestic fool of William
the Conqueror, when Duke of Normandy, who saved his
master’s life by giving timely notice of a conspiracy; then
mentioning William Picolf, who held land from King John
on performing fool’s service; Martinot of Gascoigne, fool to
Edward the First; Robert le Foll, to Edward the Second;
Ward, to Richard the Second, who, having some personal
resemblance to that king, was induced after his death to
personate him, for the purpose of an insurrection; Peche,
in the time of Henry the Seventh; Sexton, Somers, and
Williams, in the time of Henry the Eighth, the latter having
been fool to Cardinal Wolsey, and when recommended by him
to the king, after his disgrace, the faithful servant was obliged
to be moved from his old master almost by force; Chester,
who seems to have been somewhat of an impertinent disposition,
in the time of Queen Elizabeth; with others that might
be named, down to Archie Armstrong, Davie Dromon, George
Stone, and Dicky Pearce; with a few words for Jane the female
fool to Queen Mary; female fools, however, being rare.
There were also celebrated professional fools in continental
courts, as Moret, Bagot, Chichot, who was a man of courage,
and accompanied his master to the wars; Triboulet, fool to
Francis the First; and Mathurine, a female fool, who was with
Henry the Fourth of France when he was stabbed by Jean
Chastel, and was the means of the criminal being discovered.</p>

<p>Will Somers’s notion of cramming himself with salt beef,
when on a voyage, may be submitted to travellers for consideration.
When he was crossing to Boulogne with his
master, Henry, the weather was rough, and he was observed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
to eat salt beef greedily, and on the king asking him the
reason why he preferred salt meat when there was plenty of
fresh, he replied, “Don’t blame me for filling my stomach
with salt meat, because, if we are cast away, I know what a
quantity of water I shall have to drink after it.” These
personages, however, did not always enjoy their privileges
without drawbacks, and were liable to punishment, even to
whipping. George Stone, in the time of James the First,
had a sound flogging for saying, when the Earl of Nottingham
went ambassador to Spain, that there went sixty fools into
Spain, besides my lord admiral and his two sons. Archie
Armstrong, as is well known, was sentenced to have his coat
pulled over his head, discharged the king’s service, and
banished the court, for abuse of Archbishop Laud, having
given “great praise to God, but little <i>laud</i> to the devil.” It
was not, however, of much consequence to him, for he was a
careful man, and by this time—</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-w.jpg" width="130" height="127" alt="W" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capi3">WE have observed that the churchwardens of
St. Margaret’s, Westminster, were fined in
1647 for decorating their church at Christmas.
The practice, as before referred to, existed from
the earliest times; and in the churchwardens’
accounts of various parishes in the fifteenth and following centuries,
entries may be found of payments for holme, holly, and
ivy; and even during the Commonwealth the practice was not
extinct, although the puritans tried to abolish it; for in ‘Festorum
Metropolis,’ 1652, the author, who supports the cause of
Christmas, then endeavoured to be suppressed by the puritans,
mentions the trimming of churches and houses with bays,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
rosemary, holly, ivy, box, and privet, and answers the objections
made to the practice. Coles also, in his ‘Art of Simpling,’
1656, says, that in some places setting up holly, ivy, rosemary,
bays, &amp;c. in churches at Christmas, was still in use. Aubrey
mentions it as the custom in many parts of Oxfordshire for
the maid-servant to ask one of the men for ivy to dress the
house, and if he refused or neglected it, she was to steal a pair
of his breeches, and nail them up to the gate in the yard or
highway. Poor Robin, whose Almanac contains many allusions
to Christmas customs, in a Christmas song of 1695, sings,</p>

<p>
“With holly and ivy<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">So green and so gay,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">We deck up our houses</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">As fresh as the day;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">With bays and rosemary,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And laurel compleate,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And every one now</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Is a king in conceite.”</span><br />
</p>

<p>The practice has continued to the present time, when the
addition of the chrysanthemum, satin flower, and other everlastings,
mingling with the red berry of the holly and the
waxen one of the mystic misletoe, together with occasionally
the myrtle and laurustinum, have a very pleasing and cheerful
effect. In most places these greens and flowers are taken
down after Twelfth Day, except in churches, where they are
frequently kept till Lent; but, according to Herrick, they
should remain in houses until Candlemas Day, and then</p>

<p>
“Down with the rosemary and so<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Down with the baies and misletoe;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Down with the holly, ivie, all</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Wherewith ye drest the Christmas hall;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">That so the superstitious find</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">No one least branch there left behind,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">For look, how many leaves there be</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Neglected there, maids, trust to me,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">So many goblins you shall see.”</span><br />
</p>

<p>After the Restoration, the festive as well as the sacred observance
of Christmas was immediately resumed, and on the
very first Christmas Day, Evelyn says, Dr. Rainbow preached
before the king, when the service was performed with music,
voices, &amp;c., as formerly. The court revels, however, never
recovered their former splendour; plays, masks, and pageants
were nearly abandoned, and the festivities gradually assumed
the form of a mere state party, until in the time of our present
gifted queen, the plays at court have been resumed with
the utmost taste and talent. The manners of the country
in general had been much changed during the ascendancy
of the puritan party and the troubles occasioned by the
civil wars; and the habits of Charles the Second were of
too indolent and sensual a nature to care much for any
trouble in the court pageants, though gambling at the groom-porter’s
was prevalent—Charles generally opening there the
Christmas revels, if they may be so called; the play was deep,
of which many instances are given, the ladies joining in it.
A pastoral, however, by Crowne, called ‘Calisto,’ was at one
time acted by the daughters of the Duke of York (afterwards
James the Second) and the young nobility; and Lady Anne,
afterwards queen, about the same time acted the part of
Semandra, in Lee’s ‘Mithridates.’ Betterton and his wife
instructed the performers; in remembrance of which, when
Anne came to the throne, she gave the latter a pension of
£100 a year.</p>

<div class="caption">TEMPLE REVELS BEFORE CHARLES THE SECOND.</div>
</div>

<p>The Inns of Court continued their revels; and in January,
1662, Pepys mentions that while he was at Faithorne’s, the
celebrated engraver’s, he saw the king’s life-guards, he being
gone to Lincoln’s Inn, where, according to old custom, there
was a prince and all his nobles, and other matters of sport
and charge. Evelyn, who was present at these revels, speaks
somewhat disdainfully of them, calling them “the solemn
foolerie of the Prince de la Grange, where came the king,
duke,” &amp;c. It began with a grand mask, and a formal
pleading before the mock princes, grandees, nobles, and
knights of the sun. He had his lord chancellor, chamberlain,
treasurer, and other royal officers, gloriously clad and
attended; and ended in a magnificent banquet; one Mr. Lort
being the “young spark” who maintained the pageantry.</p>

<p>In January, 1688, Evelyn went, after the meeting of the
Royal Society, to see the revels at the Middle Temple, which
he calls an old, but riotous, custom, and had no relation to
virtue or policy. He did not know that the most eager in
these sports are frequently among the wisest of their class,
and that the philosopher can sometimes wear the garb of
folly gracefully.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the seventeenth century, however, these
revels ceased, having gradually fallen off, and the dignity of
master of the revels, instead of being eagerly sought for, as in
former times, required a bribe or premium to induce any
member to take it upon him. We find, for instance, in the
records of Gray’s Inn, on the 3d of November, 1682, that
Mr. Richard Gipps, on his promise to perform the office of
master of the revels that and the next term, should be called to
the bar, of grace, that is, without payment of the usual fees.</p>

<p>The amusing gossip Pepys was a much more agreeable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
Christmas companion apparently than Evelyn. How one would
like to have joined such a party as he describes on the 4th of
January, 1667, when having had company to dinner, at night,
the last thing they had was a flagon of ale and apples drunk
out of a wood cup as a Christmas draught, which made all
merry! This was keeping up the old custom of the wassail
bowl (was Knipp of this sociable party?); and no doubt Pepys
entered heartily into all the old customs, and certainly was
liberal as to his gifts; for, on December 28th, 1668, he says
that drums, trumpets, and boxes cost him much money that
Christmas. On the previous Christmas Day he had been
quiet, though probably in expectation of some approaching
party, having dined at home with his wife, who sat undressed
all day until ten at night, altering and lacing of a “noble
petticoat.” So, ladies we see, even in those times, contrived
and worked a little to vary and ornament that apparel which
adds so much grace to their charms; and though “when
unadorned, adorned the most,” is frequently quoted with
approbation, yet it probably is often misunderstood, and
simplicity with taste in ornament is always an object of
admiration. Pepys gives an amusing account of Sir George
Downing, a man of thrift, who asked some poor people (poor
relations probably) to dine with him at Christmas, and gave
them nothing but beef, porridge, pudding, and pork; there
was nothing said during the dinner, except his mother would
remark, “It’s good broth, son.” “Yes, it is good broth,” he
would answer. “Confirm all,” says the lady, and say, “Yes,
very good broth.” By and bye, she would say, “Good pork;”
to which the son would respond, “Yes, very good pork.”
And so throughout the scanty bill of fare, the humble guests
saying nothing, as they went not out of love or esteem, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
for the purpose of getting a good dinner, a rare occurrence
perhaps to some of them.</p>

<p>The Rev. Henry Teonge, chaplain of one of our ships of
war, gives the following description of a Christmas Day of
quite another sort, in 1675, “Crismas Day wee keepe thus:
At four in the morning our trumpeters all doe flatt their
trumpetts, and begin at our captain’s cabin, and thence to all
the officers’ and gentlemen’s cabins; playing a levite at each
cabine door, and bidding good morrow, wishing a merry
Crismas. After they goe to their station, viz. on the poope,
and sound three levitts in honour of the morning. At ten
we goe to prayers and sermon; text, Zacc. ix, 9. Our
captaine had all his officers and gentlemen to dinner with
him, where wee had excellent good fayre: a ribb of beefe,
plumb-puddings, minct pyes, &amp;c., and plenty of good wines
of severall sorts; dranke healths to the king, to our wives
and friends, and ended the day with much civill myrth.”
Teonge and his companions seem to have been a merry,
pleasant set, and he thus describes their ensuing Twelfth
Day. “Very ruff weather all the last night, and all this day.
Wee are now past Zante; had wee beene there this day, wee
had seene a greate solemnity; for this day being 12 day,
the Greeke Bishop of Zante doth (as they call it) baptise the
sea, with a great deale of ceremonie, sprinkling their gallys
and fishing-tackle with holy water. But wee had much
myrth on board, for wee had a greate kake made, in which
was put a beane for the king, a pease for the queen, a cloave
for the knave, a forked stick for the cuckold, a ragg for the
slutt. The kake was cut into severall pieces in the great
cabin, and all put into a napkin, out of which every one took
his piece, as out of a lottery; then each piece is broaken to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
what was in it, which caused much laughter, to see our
leiuetenant prove the coockold, and more to see us tumble one
over the other in the cabin, by reason of the ruff weather.”
The celebrated Lord Peterborough, then a youth, was one of
the party on board this ship, as Lord Mordaunt.</p>

<p>Poor Robin’s almanack, for 1675, gives some notion of the
bill of fare for Christmas at this time among the middle
classes.</p>

<p>
“Now the season of the year<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Bids thee to provide good cheer,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">For to feast thy needy neighbours,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Who do live by their hard labours;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Then thy coyn freely bestow</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">For raisins, sun, and maligo;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">No currans, prunes, nor sugar lack,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Pepper, both the white and black,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Nutmegs, ginger, cloves, and mace,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Rice for porridge i’ th’ first place;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Pork and mutton, veal and beef,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">For hungry stomachs good relief;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Pig, goose, turkey, capon, coney,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">What may be had for thy money;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Plum-pudding, and furmity,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Mutton pasties, Christmas pye;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Nappy ale, a full carouse</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">To the master of the house;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And instead of tobacco pipes,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The fidler up an old dance strikes.”</span><br />
</p>

<p>In following years there are descriptions somewhat similar.</p>

<p>New Year’s Gifts were continued; and at court they seem
to have been arranged according to rule, and were generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
in money. The aggregate amount presented was about £3000,
sent in purses, worth 30<i>s.</i> or 40<i>s.</i> each, the donors receiving
gifts of gilt plate in return. Pepys mentions his going to the
jewell office, on the 4th of January, 1661, to choose a piece
of plate for Earl Sandwich, who had given twenty pieces of
gold in a purse. His account will suffice to show the perfect
matter of routine then existing, as well as the amount of
recognised official peculation. He chose a gilt tankard,
weighing thirty-one ounces and a half, but this was an ounce
and a half more than the Earl, or the value of the Earl’s gift,
was entitled to, this limit being thirty ounces; so Pepys was
obliged to pay 12<i>s.</i> for the extra ounce and a half, so much
was it a matter of calculation. He adds, “Strange it was for
me to see what a company of small fees I was called upon by
a great many to pay there, which, I perceive, is the manner
that courtiers do get their estates.”</p>

<p>The spirit of Christmas, however, had received a check in
the time of the Commonwealth, which it struggled in vain to
overcome entirely. The hospitality and festivities in private
houses recovered, and were prevalent in the eighteenth century,
and exist in many parts, and to a certain extent, even in the
present utilitarian age; but the pageants and masks, in the
royal household, and at the Inns of Court, had received a
death-blow; although they were not actually abolished until
the latter end of the century. Evelyn mentions a riotous
and revelling Christmas at the Inner Temple, according to
custom, as late as 1697, and says that his brother, who
appears to have been a worthy, as well as a wealthy, squire,
in the previous year <i>more veterum</i>, kept a Christmas at
Wotton, in which they had not fewer than 300 bumpkins
every holyday.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1702, Poor Robin makes complaints of the falling off of
Christmas festivities.</p>

<p>
“But now landlords and tenants too<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">In making feasts are very slow;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">One in an age, or near so far,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Or one perhaps each blazing star;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The cook now and the butler too,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Have little or nothing for to do;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And fidlers who used to get scraps,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Now cannot fill their hungry chaps;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Yet some true English blood still lives,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Who gifts to the poor at <i>Christmas</i> gives,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And to their neighbours make a feast,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I wish their number were increast,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And that their stock may never decay,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;"><i>Christmas</i> may come again in play,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And poor man keep it holyday.”</span><br />
</p>

<p>Many of the popular ballads, in the latter part of the seventeenth
century, refer to the same falling off in Christmas
feasting, complaining of the degeneracy of the times. Poets
and ballad writers, however, from the earliest times, certainly
as far back as Homer, have been noted for this species of
grumbling. Praising the bygone times, in order to conceal
the annoyance at having had so many of our would-be-original
good things said by our ancestors before us.</p>

<p>Nedham in his ‘History of the Rebellion,’ 1661, alluding
to the times before the Commonwealth, says—</p>

<p>
“Gone are those golden days of yore,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">When Christmas was a high day;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Whose sports we now shall see no more,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">’Tis turn’d into Good Friday.”</span><br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>In ‘The Old and Young Courtier,’ printed in 1670, we
have comparisons between the times of Elizabeth and the
then modern times, including the following lines as to
Christmas,—</p>

<p>
“With a good old fashion, when Christmasse was come,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">To call in all his old neighbours with bagpipe and drum,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">With good chear enough to furnish every old roome,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And old liquor, able to make a cat speak, and man dumb.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14.5em;">Like an old courtier of the queen’s,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14.5em;">And the queen’s old courtier.”</span><br />
</p>

<p>then comes the contrast,—</p>

<p>
“With a new fashion, when Christmas is drawing on,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">On a new journey to London, straight we all must begone,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And leave none to keep house, but our new porter, John,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Who relieves the poor with a thump on the back with a stone.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14.5em;">Like a young courtier of the king’s,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14.5em;">And the king’s young courtier.”</span><br />
</p>

<p>In “‘Time’s Alteration; or, the Old Man’s Rehearsal,’
what brave dayes he knew a great while agone, when his old
cap was new,” there is much in the same strain,—</p>

<p>
“Black jacks to every man<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Were fill’d with wine and beer;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">No pewter pot nor can</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">In those days did appear:</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Good cheer in a nobleman’s house</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Was counted a seemly show;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">We wanted no brawn nor souse,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">When this old cap was new.“</span><br />
</p>

<p>But, ‘Old Christmas Returned,’ probably written at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
time of the Restoration and prior to the last-named ballads,
gives a more favourable view, and welcomes the return of
Christmas.</p>

<p>
“All you that to feasting and mirth are inclin’d,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Come here is good news for to pleasure your mind;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Old Christmas is come for to keep open house,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">He scorns to be guilty of starving a mouse;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Then come, boys, and welcome for diet the chief,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Plum-pudding, goose, capon, minc’d pies and roast beef.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">A long time together he hath been forgot,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">They scarce could afford for to hang on the pot;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Such miserly sneaking in England hath been,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">As by our forefathers ne’er us’d to be seen;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">But now he’s returned you shall have in brief,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Plum-pudding, goose, capon, minc’d pies and roast beef.“</span><br />
</p>

<p>The last line forms the burden of every stanza. A few years
later, in 1695, Poor Robin welcomes Christmas much in the
same terms,—</p>

<p>
“Now, thrice welcome, Christmas,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Which brings us good cheer,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Minc’d pies and plumb-porridge,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Good ale and strong beer;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">With pig, goose, and capon,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">The best that may be,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">So well doth the weather</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And our stomachs agree.”</span><br />
</p>

<p>Really, one may say with Terence, “jamdudum animus
est in patinis,” and eating seems to be a happy invention,
occupying a valuable portion of our existence. Old Tusser,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
long before, had recommended somewhat similar dishes for
Christmas,—</p>

<p>
“Brawn, pudding, and souse, and good mustard withal,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Beef, mutton, and pork, shred pies of the best,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Pig, veal, goose, and capon, and turkey well dressed;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Cheese, apples, and nuts, jolly carols to hear</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">As then in the country is counted good cheer.”</span><br />
</p>

<p>This was hearty and hospitable fare, fit for the fine old
gentry of England; but Massinger talks of something more
luxurious, hardly to be surpassed in our scientific days.</p>

<p>
“Men may talk of country Christmasses,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Their thirty pound butter’d eggs, their pies of carps’ tongues,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Their pheasants drench’d with ambergris, the carcases</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Of three fat wethers bruised for gravy to</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Make sauce for a single peacock.”</span><br />
</p>

<p>The well-known minced or Christmas pie is of considerable
antiquity, and many references are made to it in early writers.
It is customary, in London, to introduce them at the lord-mayor’s
feast, on the 9th of November, where many hundreds
of them appear; but this is an irregularity that some archæological
lord-mayor will, no doubt, by and bye, correct; at any
rate they should be eaten under protest, or without prejudice,
as lawyers say. They ought to be confined to the season of
Christmas, and the practice of using up the remnant of the
mince meat, even up to Easter, should be put a stop to by
some of our ecclesiastical reformers. So much were they
considered as connected with Christmas, that the puritans
treated their use as a superstitious observance, and after the
Restoration they almost served as a test of religious opinions.
Bunyan, when in confinement and in distress for a comfortable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
meal, for some time refused to injure his morals by eating
them when he might have done so. Misson, in the beginning
of the last century, says they were made of neats’ tongues,
chicken, eggs, sugar, currants, lemon and orange peel, with
various spices.</p>

<p>The modern receipts are similar, and the less meat they
contain the better. The following is a well-tried and much
approved one, and has been handed down in the same family
for generations: “A pound of beef suet, chopped fine; a
pound of raisins, do. stoned; a pound of currants, cleaned
dry; a pound of apples, chopped fine; two or three eggs;
allspice beat very fine, and sugar to your taste; a little salt,
and as much brandy and wine as you like:” a small piece of
citron in each pie is an improvement, and the cover or case
should be oblong, in imitation of the crache or manger where
our Saviour was laid, the ingredients themselves having been
said to have some reference to the offering of the wise men.</p>

<p>James the First’s dislike to the look of a naked sword took
its rise from about the time of his birth; but Lord Feesimple,
a cowardly character, in ‘Amends for Ladies,’ one of Field’s
plays, attributes his lack of courage to an incident during
that extensive chopping season, the necessary precursor of
minced pies. “I being in the kitchen, in my lord my father’s
house, the cook was making minc’d pies; so, sir, I standing
by the dresser, there lay a heap of plums; here was he
mincing; what did me? I, sir, being a notable little witty
coxcomb, but popp’d my hand just under his chopping-knife,
to snatch some raisins, and so was cut o’er the hand; and
never since could I endure the sight of any edge tool.”
There is a superstition that in as many different houses as
you eat minced pies during Christmas, so many happy months<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
will you have in the ensuing year; you have only therefore to
go to a different house each day in the Christmas to ensure a
happy twelvemonth, a simple receipt, if effectual. Something
like this is mentioned in ‘Dives and Pauper,’ by W. de
Worde, 1496, where the custom is reprobated of judging of
the weather of the coming year by that of the days of
Christmas. This was also prognosticated by the day of the
week on which Christmas Day fell, and there are some old
Christmas songs referring to it. In the ‘Golden Legend,’ of
the same printer, is a more laudable prejudice, “That what
persone, beynge in clene lyfe, desyre on thys daye a boone of
God; as ferre as it is ryghtfull and good for hym; our lorde
at reuerēce of thys blessid and hye feste of his Natiuite wol
graūt it to hym.”</p>

<p>The north of England is celebrated for its Christmas pies
of a different description, composed of turkeys, geese, game,
and various small birds, weighing sometimes half a hundred
weight and upwards, and calculated to meet the attacks of a
large Christmas party throughout the festival. Plum-pudding,
of which the old name is said to have been <i>hackin</i>, until the
time of Charles the Second, is another valuable dish; though,
fortunately for its admirers, not confined to Christmas time.
Plum-porridge seems to be something like the French edition
of plum-pudding brought up to our ambassador many years
since, which had been boiled without the cloth; it is, however,
mentioned by Misson, and not very many years since the
custom existed of serving up a tureen of it at the table of the
royal chaplains at St. James’s Palace.</p>

<p>An amusing little book, called ‘Round about our coal-fire,
or Christmas Entertainments,’ gives an account of the
manner of observing this festival, by the middling classes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
about the middle of the seventeenth century, and as the
writer, in the spirit of grumbling, refers to former times, he
may be supposed to carry back his reference to old times for
a century earlier. “The manner of celebrating this great
course of holydays,” he says, “is vastly different now to what
it was in former days: there was once upon a time hospitality
in the land; an <i>English</i> gentleman, at the opening of the
great day, had all his tenants and neighbours enter’d his hall
by day-break, the strong beer was broach’d, and the black-jacks
went plentifully about with toast, sugar, nutmeg, and
good Cheshire cheese; the rooms were embower’d with holly,
ivy, cypress, bays, laurel, and misleto, and a bouncing
<i>Christmas</i> log in the chimney, glowing like the cheeks of
a country milk-maid; there was the pewter as bright as
<i>Clarinda</i>, and every bit of brass as polished as the most
refined gentleman; the servants were then running here and
there, with merry hearts and jolly countenances; every one
was busy in welcoming of guests, and look’d as snug as new-lick’d
puppies; the lasses were as blithe and buxom as the
maids in good Queen <i>Bess’s</i> days, when they eat sirloins of
roast beef for breakfast; <i>Peg</i> would scuttle about to make a
toast for <i>John</i>, while <i>Tom</i> run <i>harum scarum</i> to draw a jug of
ale for <i>Margery</i>.” “In these times all the spits were sparkling,
the <i>hackin</i> (pudding) must be boil’d by day-break, or
else two young men took the maiden by the arms, and run
her round the market-place, till she was ashamed of her
laziness.” “This great festival was, in former times, kept
with so much freedom and openness of heart, that every one
in the country where a gentleman resided, possessed at least
a day of pleasure in the <i>Christmas</i> holydays; the tables were
all spread, from the first to the last, with the sirloyns of beef,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
the minc’d pies, the plumb-porridge, the capons, turkeys,
geese, and plumb-puddings, were all brought upon the board;
and all those who had sharp stomacks and sharp knives, eat
heartily and were welcome, which gave rise to the proverb,
<i>Merry in the hall, where beards wag all</i>. There were then
turnspits employed, who, by the time dinner was over, would
look as black and as greasy as a Welsh porridge-pot, but the
jacks have since turned them all out of doors. The geese,
who used to be fatted for the honest neighbours, have been of
late, sent to <i>London</i>, and the quills made into pens, to convey
away the landlord’s estate; the sheep are drove away, to raise
money to answer the loss at a game at dice or cards, and their
skins made into parchment for deeds and indentures; nay,
even the poor innocent bee, who was used to pay its tribute
to the lord once a year at least in good metheglin, for the
entertainment of the guests, and its wax converted into beneficial
plaisters for sick neighbours, is now used for the sealing
of deeds to his disadvantage.” He adds, however, “the
spirit of hospitality has not quite forsaken us; several of the
gentry are gone down to their respective seats in the country,
in order to keep their <i>Christmas</i> in the old way, and entertain
their tenants and tradesfolks as their ancestors used to do;
and I wish them a merry <i>Christmas</i> accordingly.”</p>

</div>

<p>He gives a ridiculous example of the influence of the
squire in former times; that if he asked a neighbour what it
was o’clock, the answer would be with a low scrape, “It is
what your worship pleases.” Dr. Arbuthnot, however, is
reported to have given a similar answer to Queen Anne,
“Whatever time it pleases your majesty.”</p>

<p>Among the amusements mentioned are mumming or masquerading,
when the squire’s wardrobe was ransacked for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
dresses, and burnt corks were in requisition; blind-man’s
buff, puss in the corner, questions and commands, hoop and
hide, story-telling, and dancing. In some places it seems to
have been the custom to dance in the country churches, after
prayers, crying out, “Yole, yole, yole!” &amp;c.</p>

<p>Previous to the time of Queen Anne, it had been the
custom for the officers of his court and for the suitors to
present gifts to the chancellor; the officers also exacting gifts
from the suitors to reimburse themselves. The chancery bar
breakfasted with the chancellor on the 1st of January, and
gave him pecuniary New Year’s Gifts to gain his good graces
according to their means and liberality. The practice also
was common to the other courts; and the marshal of the
King’s Bench used to present the judges with a piece of plate,
a gift which Sir Matthew Hale wished to decline, but fearing
he might injure his successors, he received the value in money,
and distributed it among the poor prisoners. Sir Thomas
More always returned the gifts, and being presented on one
occasion, by one Mrs. Goaker, with a pair of gloves containing
forty angels, he said to her, “Mistresse, since it were
against good manners to refuse your New-year’s gift, I am
content to take your gloves, but as for the <i>lining</i> I utterly
refuse it.” When Lord Cowper, however, became lord keeper,
in 1705, he determined to abolish the practice, and mentioned
the subject to Godolphin, the prime minister, that he
might not injure his patronage in the value of the place, but
he was desired, in effect, to act as he thought proper. He
incurred much obloquy at first from the other courts and
public offices where the practice likewise existed, but he
persevered, and his example was followed, though slowly,
by them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>There is an old custom in the north of England, according
to Brockett’s ‘North Country Glossary,’ that the first person
who enters the house on New Year’s Day is called First-Foot,
who is considered to influence the fate of the family, especially
the female part, for the whole of the year. Need we doubt
that the fair damsels of the household take good care that
some favoured swain shall be this influential First-Foot, hoping
perhaps that ere the next season he may have a dwelling of
his own to receive such characters, instead of enacting it
himself; of course he comes provided with an acceptable
New Year’s Gift.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-t.jpg" width="134" height="136" alt="T" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capi2">THE masks and pageants at court appear to
have been gradually abandoned from the
time of the Restoration, as before mentioned.
They were succeeded by grand
feasts and entertainments, which also fell
gradually into disuse, and latterly even that relic, the Christmas
tureen of plum-porridge, served up at the royal chaplains’
table, was omitted, and the crown-pieces under their plates
for New Year’s Gifts soon followed. The poet-laureat has
long since been relieved from that tax on his imagination,
the New Year’s Ode; and the only remaining ceremony is, I
believe, the offering on Twelfth Day. George the First and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
Second were in the habit of playing at hazard in public at the
groom-porter’s, where several of the nobility, and even some
of the princesses, staked considerable sums; but in the time of
George the Third the practice was abolished, and a handsome
gratuity given to the groom-porter by way of compensation.</p>

<p>It will be understood that the remarks as to the abatement
in Christmas festivities, apply more particularly to what may
be considered as state or public observances; for Christmas
feasting and revelry were still kept up throughout the last
century in many parts, according as the spirit of hospitality
prevailed, accompanied, but too frequently, by that excess
for which those times have gained an unenviable celebrity,
and where the motto appears to have been—</p>

<p>
“Fill up the bowl, then, fill it high,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Fill all the glasses then, for why</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Should every creature drink but I?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Why, man of morals, tell me why?”</span><br />
</p>

<p>Hals, in that very scarce book, his ‘History of Cornwall,’
reprinted, with some omissions, a few years since, by the late
Davies Gilbert, P.R.S., mentions the hospitality existing in
that county in the beginning of the eighteenth century,
referring particularly to the establishment of John Carminow,
who kept open house for all comers and goers, drinkers, minstrels,
dancers, and what not, during the Christmas time; his
usual allowance of provisions for that season being twelve fat
bullocks, twenty Cornish bushels of wheat (about sixty of
usual measure), thirty-six sheep, with hogs, lambs, and fowls,
of all sorts, and drink made of wheat and oat malt proportionable;
barley-malt being then little known in those parts.
Genuine hospitality was indeed to be met with in most of the
provinces; but still the general effect was a falling off in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
observance of Christmas. Garrick, in returning thanks to
his friend Bunbury (the caricaturist) for some Norfolk game,
at Christmas, says,—</p>

<p>
“Few presents now to friends are sent,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Few hours in merry-making spent;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Old-fashioned folks there are indeed,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Whose hogs and pigs at Christmas bleed;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Whose honest hearts no modes refine,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">They send their puddings and their chine.”</span><br />
</p>

<p>Even down to the present time—although the spirit has
sadly abated, and been modified, and is still abating under the
influence of the genius of the age, which requires work and
not play—the festivities are yet kept up in many parts in a
genial feeling of kindness and hospitality, not only in the
dwellings of the humbler classes, who encroach upon their
hard-gained earnings for the exigencies of the season, and of
those of higher grade, where the luxuries mingle with the
comforts of life; but also in the mansions of the opulent, and
in the baronial hall, where still remain the better privileges
of feudal state; and especially in the palace of our sovereign,
who wisely considers the state of royalty not incompatible with
the blessings of domestic enjoyment, and has shown how the
dignity of a reigning queen is perfectly consistent with the
exemplary performance of the duties of a wife and mother.</p>

<p>And surely a cheerful observance of this festival is quite
allowable with the requirements for mental exertion of the
present times; and hospitality and innocent revelry may be used
as safety valves for our high pressure educational power,—</p>

<p>
“Kind hearts can make December blithe as May,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And in each morrow find a New Year’s Day.”</span><br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>In some parts the wassail-bowl may yet be found, though
most commonly in the guise of toast and ale, without the
roasted apples.</p>

<p>In juvenile parties, snap-dragon, throwing its mysterious
and witch-like hue over the faces of the bystanders, is sometimes
yet permitted. Not Poins’s, who swallowed down
candle-ends for flap-dragons; but the veritable Malaga fruit,
carolling away in the frolicsome spirit, burning the fingers
but rejoicing the palate of the adventurous youth, and half
frightened little maiden reveller. The custom is old, but not
quite so old as stated in the curious play of ‘Lingua;’ by
the performance of one character, wherein—Tactus—Oliver
Cromwell is said to have had his first dream of ambition.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“<i>Memory.</i> O, I remember this dish well; it was first invented by
Pluto, to entertain Proserpina withal.</p>

<p><i>Phantastes.</i> I think not so, Memory; for when Hercules had kill’d
the flaming dragon of Hesperia, with the apples of that orchard he
made this fiery meat; in memory whereof he named it snapdragon.“</p></blockquote>

<p>There is still a species of flapdragon in the west, among the
peasantry, by means of a cup of ale or cyder with a lighted
candle standing in it: the difficulty being for a man to drink
the liquor, without having his face singed, while his companions
are singing some doggrel verses about Tom Toddy.</p>

<p>The waits still remain, as we know from auricular experience,
though their performances are of a most heterodox
nature, generally comprising a polka or galope, with some of
the latest opera airs, instead of the genuine old carol tunes;
and indeed the street carol singer himself is almost extinct,
and when met with, his stock is confined to three or four
different carols, with one tune, while the broadside carols<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
themselves are much limited, in variety, even to what they
were a few years back, my own collection, which is large,
having been commenced long since. Christmas-boxes still
prevail; self-interest will endeavour to keep these alive, and
most housekeepers have a list of regular applicants, besides a
few speculators, who think it worth while to ask. The principal
wait claims his privilege, under a regular appointment,
by warrant and admission, with all the ancient forms of the
city and liberty of Westminster, having a silver badge and
chain, with the arms of that city. The constant dustmen,
who have “no connection with the scavengers,” in order to
warn against base pretenders, leave printed applications,
sometimes of a classical nature, as, for instance, requesting
“you will not bestow your bounty on any persons who cannot
produce a medal, having on one side a bust of Julius Cæsar’s
wife, surrounded with the superscription, ‘<i>Pompeia, Jul. Cæs.
Uxor.</i>’” One hardly sees the connection between “Julius
Cæsar’s wife” and the dustman’s Christmas-box, and it gives
a curious sort of fame to be so selected; and, by parity of
reasoning, it may be assumed that the dustmen of Rome
would have carried round a medal with Nimrod’s wife.
These Christmas boxes, like New Year’s gifts, are probably of
pagan origin, but seem to differ, inasmuch as they are more
commonly given to dependents, while the latter are frequently
reciprocal, and if given by an inferior, as an offering to a
superior, meet generally with some return. Some have
derived the Christmas box from the practice of the monks to
offer masses for the safety of all vessels that went long
voyages, in each of which a box, under the controul of the
priest, was kept for offerings; this was opened at Christmas,
whence the name arose: but this does not seem a probable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
derivation. Apprentices, journeymen, and servants, even of
the higher class, such as butlers of the Inns of Court, had
their boxes. John Taylor, the water poet, without due
reverence of the law, compared Westminster Hall to a butler’s
box, at Christmas, amongst gamesters; for whosoever loseth
the box will be sure to be a winner. Some of these were
earthen boxes, with a slit to receive money, and was broken
after the collection was made; similar boxes of wood may
still be seen. Many entries may be found in old accounts of
payments made in the nature of Christmas boxes, and the
kings of France indeed used to give presents to their soldiers
at this time. In the countries where the disgraceful practice
of slavery yet remains, a young slave child would appear to
be considered as a desirable present, and advertisements to
the following effect may be occasionally seen, outraging the
feelings, and showing an utter indifference to the common
ties of humanity. “To be sold, a little mulatto, two years
of age, very pretty, and well adapted for a <i>festival present</i>.”
It is to be presumed this “very pretty” child had a mother.
Poor creature! When will this abomination of man selling
his fellow-man cease on the earth? How would the slaveholders
like to give the blacks their turn? We may remember
that about the time of Julius Cæsar’s wife, we have
lately mentioned, and long before America was known, white
slaves from Britain were imported into Rome, as valuable
articles for the sports of the amphitheatres. However, we
must leave slavery to the lash of ‘Uncle Tom’s Cabin;’ but
in describing a festival peculiarly commemorative of peace,
good will, and freedom to man, one could not help raising a
voice, however feeble, against such an evil.</p>

<p>In our younger days—addressing now of course those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
whose younger days are past—the magic-lantern, even the
common Dutch toy of the class, and especially the ‘Galanti
show,’ used to afford great amusement; and when the phantasmagoria
was introduced it seemed inexplicable. The
dissolving views, and the great advances made in exhibitions
of this class have placed the old lantern much in the back
ground, and even the old-fashioned conjuring tricks are now
known to nearly every school-boy, without taking into account
the penetrating eyes of clever little ladies fixed on you, to
find you out.</p>

<div class="caption">THE CHRISTMAS TREE.</div>
</div>

<p>In recent times the Christmas tree has been introduced
from the continent, and is productive of much amusement to
old and young, and much taste can be displayed and expense
also incurred in preparing its glittering and attractive fruit.
It is delightful to watch the animated expectation and enjoyment
of the children as the treasures are displayed and
distributed; the parents equally participating in the pleasure,
and enjoying the sports of their childhood over again. And
where can the weary world-worn man find greater relief from
his anxious toil and many cares, and haply his many sorrows,
than in contemplating the amusements of artless children,
and assisting as far as he is able; for it is not every one has
tact for this purpose, and our young friends soon detect this,
and discover the right “Simon Pure.”</p>

<p>In the younger days of many of us the Christmas Pantomime
was looked forward to as a source of the highest
gratification, and the promise was in general realized; for who
that ever saw <i>the</i> Grimaldi can ever forget the genuine
pleasure afforded by his inimitable humour, laughable simplicity,
and irresistible fun? Surely he never could belong
to private or domestic life, but must have been always the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
same—stealing tarts from his own baker, and legs of mutton
from his own butcher, and filling his pockets with his wife’s
dresses and bed-furniture. When, in after life, we were
introduced to him, in private, and found a quiet, respectable
gentleman, in plain clothes, and no red half-moon cheeks,
talking as rationally as other people, we could hardly believe
but that we had been imposed upon. Peace to thy memory,
Grimaldi! for many a joyous hour hast thou given the
young, and of many a weary hour hast thou relieved the old.</p>

<p>It is not our province to argue here whether the modern
pantomime is derived from the ancient Greek, harlequin being
Mercury; columbine, Psyche; pantaloon, Charon; and the
clown, Momus—still retaining, in his painted face and wide
mouth, the resemblance of the ancient masks. It is more
probable that they were introduced into Italy, as Sismondi
says, with other characters of the same class, in the sixteenth
century, by the wandering comedians of the time.</p>

<p>The harlequin and scaramouch in early times were, however,
speaking characters, and often celebrated wits. Constantini,
Tiberio Fiurilli (the inventor of the character of scaramouch),
Cecchini, Sacchi, and Nicholas Barbieri, were all highly
patronised by royalty; and the reputation of Domenic, who
was occasionally admitted to the table of Louis the Fourteenth,
is well known. The harlequinade or pantomime, as it is popularly
called, was introduced here in 1717, by Mr. Rich, who
was a celebrated harlequin himself, and acted under the name
of Lun. This pantomime was called ‘Harlequin Executed,’
and was performed at the theatre in Lincoln’s Inn Fields.
Between 1717 and 1761, when he retired, he composed
several harlequinades, which were all successful. The present
handsome though somewhat bizarre dress of harlequin, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
said to have been introduced by Mr. Byrne, a celebrated performer,
who was never excelled in this character, at Christmas,
1799, in ‘Harlequin Amulet,’ and at the same time he introduced
new steps and leaps. Before this time the dress was a
loose jacket and trousers, but the party-coloured jacket,
though of inferior quality, was worn by merry-andrews at
least a century before this time, and may have been modified
from the motley of the fool. The wand of harlequin would
seem to be somewhat akin to the dagger of lath of the old
vice, but used for a different purpose, and the cap is an article
of mystery, as, when placed on his head, he is rendered invisible
to the other characters.</p>

<p>The pantaloon was taken from the Venetians, and his former
dress, a gown over a red waistcoat, was that of a Venetian
citizen. Pulcinello, or Punch, as I am informed by an Italian
friend, of considerable literary acquirements—the Chevalier
Mortara—is derived from one Paolo or Paol Cinello, who
was an attendant or buffoon at an inn at Acerras, about the
year 1600, and so famous for his humour, that Silvio Fiorillo,
the comedian, persuaded him to join his troop, whence his
fame soon spread.</p>

<p>In some parts, particularly in the west and north of the
kingdom, the old Christmas play is still kept up, and a specimen
is hereafter given. The subject of these plays, which
agree in general effect, although varying in detail, is ‘St.
George and the Dragon, with the King of Egypt, and Fair
Sabra, his daughter;’ usually accompanied by ‘Father Christmas
and the Doctor,’ and sometimes by very incongruous
characters; as the great and exemplary man, whose loss the
nation is now lamenting, as that of the first character in its
history, the Duke of Wellington; and General Wolfe, who fights<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
St. George, and then sings a song about his own death,
beginning—</p>

<p>
“Bold General Wolfe to his men did say,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Come, come, ye lads, come follow me,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">To yonder mountain, which is so high;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Ye lads of honour, all for your honour,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Gain the victory or die.”</span><br />
</p>

<p>Occasionally burlesque characters are introduced, who have
nothing to do with the piece, as Hub-Bub, Old Squire, &amp;c.,
and they generally announce themselves, as one mentioned
about 1760, by Jackson, in his ‘History of the Scottish
Stage.’</p>

<p>
“My name it is Captain Calf-tail, Calf-tail,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And on my back it is plain to be seen;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Although I am simple and wear a fool’s-cap,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">I am dearly beloved of a queen.”</span><br />
</p>

<p>The buffoon of the piece used formerly to wear a calf-skin,
“I’ll go put on my devilish robes, I mean my Christmas
calf’s-skin suit, and then walk to the woods,” says Robin
Goodfellow, in the time of James the First. “I’ll put me on
my great carnation nose, and wrap me in a rousing calf-skin
suit, and come like some hobgoblin.” The performers, who
are usually young persons in humble life, are attired, including
St. George and the Dragon, much in the same manner,
having white trousers and waistcoats, showing their shirt-sleeves,
and decorated with ribbons and handkerchiefs; each
carrying a drawn sword or cudgel in his hand: as one of the
Somersetshire mummers says, “Here comes I liddle man Jan
wi’ my sword in my han!” They wear high caps of pasteboard,
covered with fancy paper, and ornamented with beads,
small pieces of looking-glass, bugles, &amp;c., and generally have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
long strips of pith hanging down from the top, with shreds of
different coloured cloth strung on them, the whole having a
fanciful and smart effect. The Turk sometimes has a turban;
Father Christmas is represented as a grotesque old man, with
a large mask and comic wig, and a huge club in his hand;
the Doctor has a three-cornered hat, and painted face, with
some ludicrous dress, being the comic character of the piece;
the lady is generally in the dress of last century, when it can
be got up; and the hobby-horse, when introduced, which is
rarely, has a representation of a horse’s hide. Wellington
and Wolfe, when they appear, are dressed in any sort of
uniform that can be procured for the nonce, and no doubt
will now be found as militia men of the county where the
play is represented.</p>

<p>These plays are of very remote origin, and founded probably
on the old mysteries before mentioned, the subject of St.
George being introduced at the time of the crusades. A play
was performed before Henry the Fifth at Windsor, in 1416,
when the Emperor Sigismund was with him, founded on the
incidents of the life of St. George, and “his ridyng and fighting
with the dragon, with his speer in his hand.”</p>

<p>It is curious to observe how near, in many cases, the style
of the early drama approaches to the homeliness of our
present country Christmas plays; so that one may suppose
that not only their structure is derived from the ancient
representations, but that even some of the speeches have
been carried down with some little modification. When
St. George struts in, saying, “Here am I, St. George,” he
is but repeating the introduction of characters sometimes
used of old. Johnson, who wrote the favourite romance of
the ‘Seven Champions of Christendome,’ about the time of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
Elizabeth, took his subject from early metrical romances,
and particularly from the story of St. George and the fair
Sabra, in the old poetical legend of Sir Bevis of Hampton,
which is older than Chaucer.</p>

<p>The Cornish had their Guary or Miracle Play from a very
early date, and amphitheatres are still existing where they
used to be performed.</p>

<p>The ‘Creation of the World,’ by William Jordan, of Helstone,
in 1611, has been published by the late Davies Gilbert,
as also two other Cornish mysteries, of much earlier date,
‘The Passion of our Lord,’ and the ‘Resurrection.’ Carew, in
his ‘Survey of the County,’ gives an amusing anecdote of the
stupidity, feigned or real, of one of the performers. It having
come to his turn, the ordinary or manager, said “Goe forthe,
man, and shew thy selfe.” The actor stepped forward, and
gravely repeated, “Goe forthe man, and shew thy selfe.” The
ordinary, in dismay, whispered to him, “Oh, you marre all the
play.” The actor, with very emphatic gesture, repeated aloud,
“Oh, you marre all the play.” The prompter, then losing his
patience, reviled the actor with all the bitter terms he could
think of, which the actor repeated with a serious countenance,
as if part of the play. The ordinary was at last obliged to
give over, the assembly having received a great deal more
sport than twenty such guaries could have afforded.</p>

<p>The play of ‘Alexander the Great,’ acted in the north, and
printed at Newcastle, in 1788, is very similar to the Cornish
St. George; and others, all showing from their likeness a
common origin, may be found in Scotland, Lancashire,
Yorkshire, Gloucestershire, Dorsetshire, and other parts. In
Yorkshire and Northumberland, and other places in the north,
they had the sword or rapier dance, where the performers were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
dressed in frocks, or white shirts, with paper or pasteboard
helmets,—calling themselves Hector, Paris, Guy of Warwick,
and other great names, and performing many evolutions with
their swords, accompanied by a fiddler or doctor, and a character
called Bessy.</p>

<p>Cards, dancing, and music, are still resorted to; but the
brawl, the pavan, the minuet, the gavot, the saraband, and
even the country dance, excepting in the exhilirating form of
Sir Roger de Coverley, have given place to the quadrille, the
polka, and the galope; and if we look at the figures of some
of the old dances, our drawing-room coryphees will not be
sorry to be spared the task of learning them. Take the
account of the brawl in one of our old plays, which one of the
characters says she has forgotten: “Why! ’tis but two singles
on the left, two on the right, three doubles, a traverse of six
round; do this twice, curranto pace; a figure of eight, three
singles broken down, come up, meet two doubles, fall back,
and then honour.” But if we have not gained much in the
exhibition of this accomplishment, it is amply made up in the
quality of our domestic musical acquirements, where, instead
of a ditty or lesson, or sonata, droned out on the virginals
or harpsichord, our ladies now treat us not only with the
elegant compositions of the talented Osborne, and other able
modern writers, but with the classical works of Beethoven,
Mozart, and other masters of the noble science. Many of
our male amateurs also, both vocal and instrumental, have
acquired considerable skill; but as they in general are pretty
well aware of their own merits, it will not be necessary to
remind them here. Singing, however, is more particularly in
quest at Christmas time, but the old carol is rarely now to be
met with, though several of them possess much pleasing harmony.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
One of the great gratifications, however, of these
Christmas meetings, where they can take place, is the re-union,
even though for a short space, of relations and friends, renewing,
as it were, the bonds of love and friendship; casting off
for a time the cares of the world; joining, if not audibly, yet
mentally, in the praise of that Creator, who has given us so
much “richly to enjoy;” and, if it be His will that loved and
familiar faces, one by one, drop off, yet are we not left comfortless;
for though they cannot return to us, we, through
faith in Him, whose Nativity we now commemorate, shall
join them, in that blessed region, where the cares and trials
of our weary pilgrimage here will be forgotten, as a dream
that is past; and hope shall be fulfilled, when “the desire
cometh,” that “is a tree of life.”</p>

<p>Our pagan ancestors observed their sacred festival at this
season, in honour of their unknown gods, and of a mystic
mythology, founded on the attributes of the Deity; but corrupted
in the course of ages into a mass of fables and idolatry:
but we keep it in commemoration of Him, who, as at this
time, mercifully revealed Himself to us; who is omniscient
and omnipresent, and of whom my lamented and learned
friend, Dr. Macculloch, has emphatically said, referring to the
true Christian, “Not an object will occur to him, in which
he will not see the hand of God, and feel that he is under the
eye of God; and if he but turn to contemplate the vacancy of
the chamber around him, it is to feel that he is in the presence
of his Maker; surrounded, even to contact, by Him who fills
all space. Feeling this, can he dare to be evil?”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-t.jpg" width="134" height="136" alt="T" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capi2">THE subjects of the offerings at the Epiphany,
with the accompanying legend of the Three
Kings or Magi, and that of carol singing,
require so much space that it has been
thought preferable to devote particular chapters
to them, rather than interrupt the narrative of Christmas
festivities.</p>

<p>The offerings on the day of the Epiphany were in remembrance
of the Manifestation of our Saviour to the Gentiles,
and of the gifts made to Him by the Magi, or Wise Men of
the East; when “the kings of Tarshish and of the isles
brought presents; the kings of Sheba and Saba offered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
gifts,” or, as the ‘Bee Hive,’ of the Romish Church, states
it, “Kings came out of the Moor’s land to worship Christ.”</p>

<p>The king of the bean was the forerunner of our Twelfth-Day
King; in the Saturnalia a king was elected, and as some
say by beans, by way of lot, and he was invested with full
power over the guests, and from him the lord of Misrule,
under his various names, may take his origin; but the king
of the bean and Twelfth-Day king were strictly confined to
Twelfth Day, and ephemeral in their rule.</p>

<p>At the time of our Saviour’s birth, there was an expectation
of his appearance among many of the heathen nations;
it is said even that the initiated in the religious mysteries of
the Persians, possessed as a secret handed down from the
time of Zoroaster, that a divine prophet should be born of a
virgin, whose birth should be proclaimed by the appearance
of a bright star. The celebrated prophecy of Balaam, also
made an impression on the surrounding nations; “I shall see
him, but not now; I shall behold him, but not nigh; there
shall come a star out of Jacob, and a sceptre shall rise out of
Israel, and shall smite the corners of Moab, and destroy all
the children of Sheth.” When the star eventually appeared,
the Magi, or Three Kings, as they are commonly called, eagerly
followed it to the cradle of our Saviour to pay their adorations,—</p>

<p>
“See how from far upon the eastern road,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The star-led wizards haste with odours sweet.”</span><br />
</p>

<p>According to old legends, which are always fond of embellishment,
this star was an eagle flying and beating the air
with his wings, and had within it the form and likeness of a
young child, and above him the sign of a cross. D’Israeli
mentions some rays of this star, in a collection of relics.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>There are numerous histories of the magi or kings themselves,
all agreeing as to their number having been three, but
some of them differing entirely in name. We may, however,
consider Melchior, Jasper, and Balthasar, to be the genuine
ones, and certainly more euphonious than Galagalath, Magalath,
and Tharath; but even the legends that agree in the
names, differ in the description of their persons, or in the
appropriation of the presents given by them; but as Bede, in
the seventh century, was the first writer in this country who
has given a description of them, which he, no doubt, took
from some earlier account, we may adopt, in the main, his
history. According to this, Melchior was old, with gray hair
and long beard, and offered gold to our Saviour in acknowledgment
of his sovereignty; Jasper was young, without any
beard, and offered frankincense in recognition of the divinity;
and Balthasar was of a dark complexion, as a Moor, with a
large spreading beard, and offered myrrh to our Saviour’s
humanity; or as one of my family, Sandys the traveller,
translates the description from ‘Festa Anglo-Romana,’—</p>

<p>
“Three kings the King of kings three gifts did bring,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Myrrh, incense, gold, as to man, God, a king.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Three holy gifts be likewise given by thee</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">To Christ, even such as acceptable be</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">For myrrha tears; for frankincense impart</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Submissive prayers; for pure gold a pure heart.”</span><br />
</p>

<p>Many of the ancient ecclesiastical writers endeavoured to
find out mystical meanings in every sacred subject, in which,
however, they have followers in the present day; so that the
variety in appearance of the Three Kings may be supposed to
have some reference to the three races of man, where, according<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
to the Armenian tradition, Shem had the region of the
tawny, Japhet that of the ruddy, and Ham that of the
blacks.</p>

<p>The early heralds, who considered that none could be
ennobled, or good, or great, without the aid of their science,
little anticipating that, in after times, any one might have
“arms found” for him, with crest and motto, according to
order and price, and having some vague notions of the early
origin of the same, emblazoned coats of arms for all the great
characters in the Bible, commencing with Adam—giving one
even to our Saviour. It may, therefore, be readily supposed
that the Three Kings had theirs. Their journey lasted twelve
days, during which they required no refreshment, it seeming
to them as one day. After they had presented their gifts,
the Virgin Mary gave them in return one of our Saviour’s
swaddling clothes, which they took as a most noble gift. In
after days they were baptised by St. Thomas, and some time
subsequent to their deaths, their bodies were taken by the
Empress Helena, in the fourth century, to Constantinople;
from thence they were moved to Milan; and when this city
was taken by the Emperor Frederick, in 1164, he gave these
relics to Reinaldus, Archbishop of Cologne, whence they are
commonly called the Three Kings of Cologne. There is some
story of Louis the Eleventh having moved some of the bones
from Cologne, as they were considered to be of sovereign
virtue in royal ailments. Their names even were thought of
great efficacy in falling-sickness and madness, if written on
parchment, and hung about the patient’s neck, with the sign
of the cross; and, as it is to be presumed in all these cases,
with a good deal of faith. Another charm is rather more
extensive in its benefits:—</p>

<p>“Ces billets ont touché aux trois têtes de S.S. Rois à Cologne.</p>

<p>It was found in the purse of Jackson, a celebrated smuggler,
convicted of murder, in 1749, but did not prove efficacious
with him, as he died, struck with horror, just after being
measured for his irons. Another charm is to write their
names in virgin wax, with a cross against each, and place it
under the head of one who has had any thing stolen from
him, and he will dream of what has become of the stolen
article. If he does not remember his dream, it must be his
own fault, of course. The names of the Three Kings, together
with those of the four shepherds, who went to our Lord in
Bethlehem—Misael, Achael, Cyrianus, and Stephanus—(in the
Chester mysteries they have the more humble names of
Harvey, Tudd, and Hancken), form a charm against the bite
of serpents, and other venomous reptiles and beasts. One
John Aprilius, when he was hung, having implored their
assistance, was more successful than Jackson; for, after having
been suspended for three days, he was found to be alive, and
being taken down, he went to Cologne, half naked, with the
halter about his neck, to return thanks, and, probably, to
request that next time he might be taken down a little sooner.
One Roprecht, a robber, was hung for certain crimes against
society, but his body disappeared from the gibbet, whether
by the intervention of the Three Kings or not, was unknown.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
In a short time, however, it was found hanging again, with
the addition of a pair of boots and spurs. As he was now
really dead, and could tell no tales, this freak of his absconding
for a short time, for the purpose, apparently, of being
hung over again in boots and spurs, could not be explained by
the people; but the fact was, that some passer-by had, in the
first instance, found him still living, and compassionately
maintained him for some time; but, like the warmed viper,
he returned to his old knavish practices, and stole his benefactor’s
horse, when, being pursued and taken, he was, after
some trouble, replaced in his old noose, and left to his fate.</p>

<p>According to Picart, the Feast of the Epiphany was established
in the fourth century, though Brady says it was first
made a separate feast in 813. It became, however, one of
the most popular of the Christmas festivals, and some of the
most splendid entertainments were given on this day; and in
our times it is probably the most popular day throughout the
Christmas, thanks to the Twelfth Cake, and drawing for characters,
with other amusements. It was a very early custom
to choose a Twelfth day king, or king of the bean, as he was
formerly called; and this was originally a case of election,
although afterwards, as at present, taken by lot; but, at the
same time, the practice of election was also continued, even
to recent times; the French court choosing one of the
courtiers for king, who was then waited on by the other
nobles, as late as the time of the revolution, when, amongst
other vagaries, the ruling citizens, for the time being, changed
“La fête de Rois,” to “La fête de Sans-culottes.” The students
and citizens in the various cities and universities in Germany,
also, used to choose one of their companions for king;
and this practice would appear preferable to our practice of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
drawing for characters, and would probably ensure the election
of the person best calculated to promote the wit and enjoyment
of the evening, instead of taking the chance of the least
adapted, or who may be called the “slowest” of the party
drawing the lucky card. Even now, however, occasionally
an election is made, and the fortunate elect then chooses his
court for the evening.</p>

<p>In the last century, the Twelfth Night cards represented
ministers, maids of honour, and other attendants of a court,
and the characters were to be supported throughout the night.
At present they are in general grotesque, and seldom possess
much wit or humour. Many early notices may be met with
of the antiquity of the custom. In “Les Crieries de Paris,”
of the thirteenth century, the “Gastel à fève orroiz” is mentioned,
which is described as a cake, with a bean for the “Fête
de Rois,” and we shall find a present given to the court
minstrels on the Epiphany, in the name of the king of the
bean, in the time of Edward the Third. Down to the time
of the civil wars, the feast was observed with great splendour,
not only at court, but at the Inns of Court, and the universities
(where it was an old custom to choose the king by the
bean in a cake), and in private mansions and houses.</p>

<p>The lord mayor and aldermen, and the crafts of London
also, used to go to St. Paul’s on Twelfth Day, to hear a
sermon, which is mentioned as an old custom, in the early
part of Elizabeth’s reign.</p>

<p>The usual course, of choosing by the bean, was to insert it
in the cake, though sometimes a piece of money was put in
instead. The cake was then cut up, and the person to whom
the piece with the bean fell was the king for the evening.
Sometimes pieces were allotted to our Saviour, and the Virgin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
Mary, and the Three Kings, which were given to the poor;
and if the bean should be in either of these portions, the king
was chosen by pulling straws. Baby-cake, in the mask of
‘Christmas,’ was attended by an usher, bearing a great cake,
with a bean and pea. The king elect chose his queen, or
occasionally a pea was inserted in the cake for the purpose,
and they chose their officers; and in France, when either of
them drank, the company were to cry out, on pain of forfeit,
“Le Roi (ou la Reine) boit.”</p>

<p>Louis the Fourteenth, on one occasion, in his youth, was
king of the bean, but would not undertake the office, handing
it over to his governor, De Souvre.</p>

<p>Herrick, in the seventeenth century, refers to the practice
of choosing by the bean and pea:—</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">“Now, now the mirth comes,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">With the cake full of plums,</span><br />
Where beane’s the king of the sport here;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Beside we must know,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">The pea also</span><br />
Must revell as queene in the court here.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Begin then to chuse,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">This night as ye use,</span><br />
Who shall for the present delight here;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Be a king by the lot,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And who shall not</span><br />
Be Twelfth-Day queene for the night heere.“<br />
</p>

<p>The French twelfth-cake is still plain in appearance, containing
a bean: it was composed, about 250 years since, of
flour, honey, ginger and pepper; what it is made of now,
Monsieur Verey can no doubt tell, if he will; they are however<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
far exceeded in appearance by the rich frosted, almond-pasted,
festooned, bedizened, and carefully-ornamented cakes
of the English pattern, gladdening the eyes of joyful holiday
young people, and through them the hearts of their parents.
The eager grouping of passers-by, to see the shop-windows
crowded with these elegant productions of confectionary
science, causes stoppages in our highways and thoroughfares,
with reiterated “Move-ons” from our policemen. About
twenty-five years ago there was one exhibited, said to weigh
one ton, but it might have weighed any given number, being
simply several large wedges of cake, all plastered together, at
the top and sides, with one uniform coat of sugar-frost.
Speaking from memory, and with a taste somewhat blunted
to these enjoyments, the flavour was somewhat below the
average, and curiosity was rewarded by ascertaining—to use
a bad pun, which it is hoped may be excused—that it really
was [Greek: mega hkakon] (mega cakon).</p>

<p>The adoration of the Magi was a favourite subject in the
early mysteries. The celebrated Marguerite de Valois, Queen
of Navarre, wrote one on it as well as on the Nativity, the
Massacre of the Innocents, and the Flight into Egypt, which
were all published in 1547, in the collection of her works,
called ‘Marguerites de la Marguerite des princesses, très-illustre
Reyne de Navarre.’</p>

<p>There are said indeed to have been representations in the
French churches of the Three Magi as early as the fifth century;
and there are French mysteries relating to them in the
eleventh century, and also a Latin one mentioned by Lebeuf,
wherein Virgil accompanies the kings on their journey; and at
the end of the Adoration joins them very piously in the benedicamus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>The first feast of the Three Kings was celebrated at Milan
in 1336, by the friar preachers, and was called the Feast of
the Star. A golden star was exhibited, as if in the sky,
preceding them; the Three Kings appeared on horseback,
crowned and richly clad, with a large retinue, and bearing
golden cups filled with myrrh, frankincense, and gold. They
asked Herod where Christ should be born, and having been
answered in Bethlehem, proceeded to the church of St. Eustorgius,
preceded by trumpets, horns, apes, baboons, &amp;c. In
the church, on one side of the altar, was the representation of
a manger, with an ox and an ass; and the infant Saviour in
the arms of his mother, to whom the kings then made their
offerings. It forms a favourite subject in our early English
Mysteries, which were suppressed early in the time of James
the First; but it was introduced as a puppet-show at Bartholomew
fair as late as the time of Queen Anne. In ‘Dives and
Pauper,’ 1496, it is stated, “For to represente in playnge at
Crystmasse Herodes and the Thre Kynges and other processes
of the gospelles both than and at Ester, and other times also,
it is lefull and com̄endable.”</p>

<p>Several provincial French collections of Carols, published
within these few years, contain a Mystery or Scripture play of
the Adoration. The Feast of the Star, just mentioned, was
retained to some extent in Germany up to the end of the last
century; and Hoffman, in his ‘Horæ Belgicæ,’ contains the
Star-song used on the occasion, as old perhaps as the fifteenth
century, of which a nearly literal translation is given hereafter.
The history of these kings was a favourite subject for tapestry
and illuminations for books, of which numerous examples
might be given; also for paintings on church and monastic
walls, as Barclay, in his Egloges, says,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">“. . the Thre Kinges, with all their company,</span><br />
Their crownes glistning bright and oriently,<br />
With their presentes and giftes misticall.<br />
All this behelde I in picture on the wall.”<br />
</p>

<p>The offerings by our sovereigns of gold, frankincense,
and myrrh, continued down to the present time, is referred
to elsewhere in this work. Melchior was said to have presented
a golden apple, formerly belonging to Alexander the
Great,—made from the tribute of the world—and thirty
pieces of gold.</p>

<p>The history of these pieces of gold is curious, showing
how ingeniously these legends were dovetailed together.
They were first coined by Terah, the father of Abraham,
and taken by the latter, when he left the land of the Chaldees.
They were by him paid away to Ephron as part of
the purchase money for the field and cave of Machpelah.
The Ismaelites then, according to one account, paid them back
as the price of Joseph to his brethren; and as, according to
our version of the Scriptures, the price of Joseph was but
twenty pieces, we may imagine the remainder were given for
some other purpose; though Adam Davie, who wrote in 1312,
referring to this event, says—“Ffor thritti pens thei sold that
childe.” The money was afterwards paid to Joseph by his
brethren during the time of scarcity; and on the death of
Jacob, his son paid them to the royal treasury of Sheba for
spices to embalm him. The celebrated Queen of Sheba, on
her visit to Solomon, presented them to him with many other
gifts. In the time of his son Rehoboam, when the King of
Egypt spoiled the temple, the King of Arabia, who accompanied
him, received these pieces of money in his share of the
plunder, and in his kingdom they remained until the time of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
Melchior, who presented them to our Saviour. On the flight
into Egypt, the holy family were closely pursued by Herod’s
soldiers, and coming to a field where a man was sowing asked
the way: when they had passed on, the corn miraculously
sprang up; just afterwards Herod’s soldiers arrived and
inquired of the sower if he had seen our Saviour and his
parents, but he told them that no one had passed since his
corn was sown, on which the soldiers turned back and gave
up the pursuit.</p>

<p>This legend is mentioned in the carol of the Carnal and the
Crane. In the hurry of the flight the Virgin Mary dropped
these pieces of money and the other gifts. They were found
by a shepherd, who kept them by him, and in after years,
being afflicted by some disease incurable by mortal aid, applied
to our Saviour, who healed him, and he then offered these
gifts at the high altar. They were subsequently paid to Judas
by the priests as the reward of his perfidy. There are two
reasons given for his requiring thirty pieces of money: one
that he considered he had lost thirty pieces by the box of
precious ointment not having been sold for 300 pence, of
which he would have purloined the tenth part; and the other,
that having been sent by our Saviour, on Holy Thursday, with
this amount of money, to provide for the last supper, he fell
asleep in the way and was robbed. In the midst of his
distress the rich <i>Jew</i>, Pilate, met him, and he then agreed to
betray his master for the amount he had lost.</p>

<p>In one of our ancient chronicles there is a legend of the
life of Judas, before he became an apostle, very similar, in
many respects, to the well-known history of Œdipus, which
need not be repeated here. When, smitten by remorse, he
returned the money to the priests, and destroyed himself:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
they applied half in purchase of the potter’s field, and with
the other half bribed the soldiers who guarded the sepulchre
to say that the disciples came by night and stole the body of
our Saviour. After this, having performed their mission,
they were dispersed, and all traces of them lost. They were
made of the purest gold, the term pieces of silver used in
some parts of our translation with reference to them, being,
according to the history, merely a common or generic name
for money, like <i>argent</i> in French; on one side was a king’s
head crowned, and on the other some unintelligible Chaldaic
characters, and they were said to have been worth three
florins each.</p>

<p>There are many old manuscript histories of these kings
in existence, at the Museum and elsewhere, one of which
resolves the whole story into alchemy; and early printed
histories, as by Güldenschaiff, in 1477, and Wynkyn de
Worde, in the beginning of the sixteenth century. Some
account of particularly splendid feasts on Twelfth Day have
been mentioned in the foregoing pages.</p>

<p>Their names were occasionally used as a term of adjuration,
which, in former times, whatever may be case now, was
a mark of respect. Diccon, in that quaint production
‘Gammer Gurton’s Needle,’ of which the plot and catastrophe
would rather astonish a modern audience, says to
Dame Chat,—</p>

<p>
“There I will have you swear by oure dere lady of Bullaine,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Saint Dunstone and Saint Donnyke, with the Three Kings of Kullain,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">That ye shall keep it secret.”</span><br />
</p>

<p>I will now conclude this chapter with the ‘Star Song,’
before referred to—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>
“We come walking with our staves<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Wreathed with laurel,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">We seek the Lord Jesus, and would wish</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">To put laurel on his knees;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Are the children of Charles the King,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Pater bonne Franselyn, Jeremie.</span><br />
</p>

<p>
We did come before Herod’s door, &amp;c.<br />
Herod, the king, came himself before, &amp;c.<br />
<br />
Herod then spake with a false man’s heart, &amp;c.<br />
Why is the youngest of three so swart? &amp;c.<br />
<br />
Altho’ he is swart, he is well be known, &amp;c.<br />
In orient land he has a throne, &amp;c.<br />
<br />
We all came over the lofty hill, &amp;c.<br />
And there saw we the Star stand still, &amp;c.<br />
<br />
Oh, Star! you must not stand still so, &amp;c.<br />
But must with us to Bethlehem go, &amp;c.<br />
<br />
To Bethlehem, the lovely town, &amp;c.<br />
Where Mary and her child sit down, &amp;c.<br />
<br />
How small the child, and how great the good, &amp;c.<br />
A blessed New Year that gives us God, &amp;c.<br />

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-t.jpg" width="134" height="136" alt="T" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capi2">THE term carol, appears originally to have
signified a song, joined with a dance, a union
frequently found in early religious ceremonies;
and it is used in this sense by Chaucer,
Boccacio, Spenser, and others. By some it
has been derived from <i>cantare</i>, to sing, and <i>rola</i>, an interjection
of joy. It was, however, applied to joyous singing, and
thus to festive songs; and as these became more frequent at
Christmas, it has for a long time past, though not exclusively
yet more particularly, designated those sung at this feast.
But strictly, it should be applied only to those of a cheerful
character, and not to the Christmas hymn, which is of a more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
solemn cast; many of them, indeed, being more suitable for
Passion Week than for Christmas; and a large and appropriate
collection might be readily selected for that season, and
an interesting work made to illustrate them. In practice,
however, the word carol is applied indiscriminately to both
classes, whether cheerful or solemn.</p>

<p>In the earlier times, music, both instrumental and vocal,
was introduced into religious ceremonies, and was a necessary
accompaniment to all the sacred feasts and games. Jubal’s
harp or organ, whatever that instrument may have been, was
doubtless, like the harp of David, used on such occasions, and
the science of music was a necessary part of the education of
many of the priesthood. In the records and sculptures of the
Hebrews, Greeks, Romans, Egyptians, and other great nations
of antiquity, and in the recent discoveries at ancient Nineveh,
we find descriptions and representations connected with it.</p>

<p>The Hebrews, as we know, had numerous psalms and
hymns, one of the earliest on record being that of Miriam and
her companions, on the overthrow of the Egyptians, when
they celebrated the downfall of the horse and his rider, with
timbrels and with dances. The Druids had recourse to music,
and the Anglo-Saxons and Gothic nations made great use of
hymns in their public worship. Some early specimens of the
primitive music have been handed down to us, but do not
impress us with much respect for the powers of harmony of
our forefathers, and their neumes, and other obscure and
imperfect methods of notation, must have cramped them.
Certain of the old chants have a pleasing solemnity, and it
has of late been much the custom to revive or to imitate them,
commencing even with the old Ambrosian chant; though, as
our ancestors considered the introduction of the Gregorian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
chant to have been a great improvement on it, we may very
safely be of the same opinion, as this is really fine, and we
need not here trouble ourselves with the Lydian, Phrygian,
or Dorian modes. With respect to the merits of ancient music,
our taste and skill have been so gradually improving, that
we can scarcely be judges of what—though flat, insipid, and
meaningless to us—might have given much gratification to the
less educated ears of former times. Even within the last few
years, a great advance has been made in our own musical
knowledge: pieces and composers, popular in the early part
of this century, are now scarcely known; and recollected,
perhaps (if at all), with amazement at their having ever been
listened to; while works of the great masters, then thought
impracticable, and containing difficulties not understood, or
considered insuperable, are played and appreciated in most
good musical meetings. More might be said on this subject,
but want of space, and not of materials, compels a postponement,
till some future opportunity. It may be mentioned,
that much curious information, respecting our ancient national
airs, with the tunes themselves, will be found in the very
interesting work on the subject, by my friend, Mr. William
Chappell, who, it is to be hoped, will, at no distant time,
increase our obligation to him, by further publication from
the large store in his possession, still unedited. Many of
these airs are very pleasing, yet simple in construction, and
still remain popular after the lapse of centuries; they are,
however, much more recent than the ancient music before
referred to.</p>

<p>The Romans had their hymns on the calends of January,
and the practice was adopted by the early Christians, especially
on their Sabbath-days and festivals, and on the vigils of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
saints. St. Paul and St. James both refer to this custom,
and Pliny the younger, in a letter to Trajan, mentioning the
Christians, says, “They were wont to meet together on a
certain day, before it was light, and sing among themselves,
alternately, a hymn to Christ, as to God.” Bishop Taylor
observes, that the well-known “Gloria in Excelsis,” sung by
the angels to the shepherds, on the night of the Nativity, is
the earliest Christmas carol. We have many carols now
existing, that are founded on the appearance of the angels to
the shepherds; and the subject is represented in several of the
ancient mysteries, and occasionally in a very familiar and
homely manner.</p>

<p>In the Chester mysteries, for instance, the three shepherds,
with their man Trowle, who is the buffoon of the piece (though
the greater part of the play of the shepherds is of a humorous
nature, comprising the homely dialogue of rustic labourers),
having eaten their supper of sheep’s head, soused in ale, with
onions, garlic, and leeks, and other viands of like quality, and
plenty of ale, are having a bout at wrestling, where Trowle
throws his masters. In the midst of their sport the star
appears, and afterwards the angels’ song is heard. They then
proceed reverently, though “rude in speech,” to Bethlehem,
and make their offerings; the first shepherd, addressing our
Saviour,—</p>

<p>
“Heale, Kinge of heaven, so hie,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Borne in a crebe,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Mankinde unto Thee</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Thou haste made fullye.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Heale, kinge! borne in a mayden’s bower,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Profittes did tell thou shouldest be our succore,</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Thus clarkes doth saye.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Lor, I bringe thee a bell;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I praie Thee save me from hell,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">So that I may with Thee dwell,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And serve thee for aye.”</span><br />
</p>

<p>The second Shepherd presents a flagon with a spoon, and
the third a cap, but finishes his speech with some degree of
pathos.</p>

<p>
“This gueifte, Sonne, I bringe Thee is but small,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And though I come the hyndmoste of all,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">When Thou shall them to Thy blesse call,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Good Lorde, yet thinke on me.”</span><br />
</p>

<p>Well may we say, seeing how small our gifts are, “Good
Lord, yet think on me.”</p>

<p>In the second century, Telesphorus refers to the Christians
celebrating public worship, on the night of the Nativity, and
then solemnly singing the angels’ hymn, because in the same
night, Christ was declared to the Shepherds by an angel; and
in the early times of Christianity the bishops were accustomed
to sing hymns on Christmas Day among their clergy.
Aurelius Prudentius, towards the end of the fourth century,
wrote a divine hymn or carol in Latin, which is still extant;
but, besides that it consists of twenty-nine stanzas, it is not
of sufficient general interest to be printed here.</p>

<p>The Bretons were very similar in manners and language to
the inhabitants of Britain, many of them having had the
same origin, and being, in fact, a colony from our island.
The Cornouaille of Bretagne, however, must not be confounded
with our province of that name by the well-wishers
of the latter, because the romance writers do not speak in
such terms of some of their knights as their friends might
have desired.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>There is a Breton song, said to be as old as the fifth century,
arranged as a dialogue between a Druid and a scholar, which
is similar in idea and construction to the carol beginning,
“In those twelve days,” and to that called ‘Man’s Duty,’
though the twelve subjects given are quite different from
those in the carols, and refer to some druidical superstitions.
It is called ‘Ar Rannou,’ or ‘Les Series,’ and is in the
“dialecte de Cornouaille.” The early missionaries engrafted
on this a poem or song of the same construction, where the
twelve subjects were connected with the Christian religion,
and agree much with those in the carols, which there is fair
reason to suppose may have been taken from this early poem.
These subjects are,—one God; two Testaments; three
Patriarchs; four Evangelists; five books of Moses; six
water-vessels at Cana of Galilee; seven Sacraments; eight
Beatitudes; nine degrees of Angels; ten Commandments;
eleven stars that appeared to Joseph; twelve Apostles. The
hymn itself is in Latin, and at the end of each verse all the
previous subjects are repeated in the style of the ‘House that
Jack built,’ an example to which I refer simply from its being
so well known, the style itself being of great antiquity, and
taken originally from an old Hebrew hymn, of which some
particulars, with a translation, may be found in Halliwell’s
‘Nursery Rhymes of England;’ but the butcher, the ox, the
dog, and the cat, with the other characters mentioned there,
have all a mystical meaning. The last verse of the old Latin
hymn may be given as a specimen:—</p>

<p>
“....Die mihi quid duodecim?<br />

</p>

<p>In the fourth century, St. Ambrose introduced the chant
known by his name, at Milan, of which he was the bishop,
and some reformation took place in church music; and when
the Gregorian chant was composed, about two centuries later,
a still greater advance was made. The Anglo-Saxons, after
their conversion, preserved their fondness for religious music,
it being a common practice in their guilds that each member
should sing two psalms daily, one for the dead, and the other
for the living members. Particular hymns were appropriated
to particular feasts; the Nativity, therefore, especially had its
own. When the Anglo-Normans obtained the government,
they equally encouraged music, and introduced greater pomp
into their ceremonies.</p>

<p>In the twelfth century, or sooner, the monks composed
legends in verse, of the lives of the saints, &amp;c., for the proper
holidays; and religious pieces suited to the time, with appropriate
hymns, were recited at Christmas; some Latin hymns
of this description of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries,
being still extant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>King John, in 1201, gave 25<i>s.</i> to the clerks who chanted
“Christus vincit” before him on Christmas Day; and these
spiritual songs were gradually introduced into the palace, and
private houses, together with others for the same purpose, of
a lighter description, which were found acceptable, and thus
the carol had its origin.</p>

<p>The theatrical exhibitions at this season, of which the subjects
were originally taken from the Holy Scriptures, as they
gradually ripened into maturity, also occasionally had songs
incidental to them. The angels’ song to the Shepherds, in
the Towneley mysteries, may be taken as a carol.</p>

<p>
“Herkyn, hyrdes, awake, gyf lovyng ye shalle,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">He is borne for youre sake, Lorde perpetualle;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">He is comen to take and rawnson you alle,</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Ye shalle fynde Hym beforne</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14.5em;">Betwix two bestys.“</span><br />
</p>

<p>In the Coventry pageant of the Shearmen and Tailors,
towards the beginning of the fifteenth century, there are three
songs which are in the nature of carols. One, by the women,
is a lullaby song, on our infant Saviour, beginning, “Lully
lulla, thou littell tine’ child,” and referring to Herod’s wrath.
One by the Shepherds is short, and may serve as an example.</p>

<p>
“As I out rode this endenes (last) night,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Of thre ioli sheppardes I saw a sight,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And all a bowte there fold a star shone bright,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">They sange terli terlow,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">So mereli the sheppards ther pipes can blow.”</span><br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>In the same pageant one of the prophets says—</p>

<p>
“Novellis, novellis of wondrfull mrvellys,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Were ’hy and defuce vnto the heryng,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Asse scripture tellis these strange novellis to you I bryng.”</span><br />
</p>

<p>One of the earliest known carols, however, in our island, is
the Anglo-Norman one, of the thirteenth century, first printed
in Douce’s ‘Illustrations of Shakespeare,’ with a free translation,
which is not only of a cheerful, but of a festive nature,
giving the</p>

<p>
“....host’s command,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And Christmas joins him hand in hand,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">To drain the brimming bowl.”</span><br />
</p>

<p>It is in effect a Christmas drinking song.</p>

<p>Edward the Fourth had regulations for the singing of songs
before him at Christmas, by the clerks and children of his
chapel, and the custom of singing songs had now become
general. In some of the early ones, scraps of Latin were
introduced, probably from the Christmas hymns, which they
were intended in a great measure to supersede; as, for
example, from additional MS., 5665, British Museum, about
the time of Henry the Eighth, which contains several others.</p>

<p>
“Now make us ioye in this feste,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">In quo xpûs natus est,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">A patre unigenitus,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">iij zong maydens cam till us,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Syng we to hym and say well come,</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">So myzthi a lord ys non as he,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Veni Redemptur omniu gentium.“</span><br />
</p>

<p>Others, again, were in a simple, familiar style, adapted to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
the hearths of our unsophisticated ancestors; a style, by the
by, we may soon expect to see again, if the taste for mediævalism
and præ-Raphaelism extends much more, and we shall
have a modern ode to parliament, beginning—</p>

<p>
“Sit you merry gentlemen,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Let nothing you dismay.”</span><br />
</p>

<p>In the fifteenth century, the Low Countries had their carols,
similar to the English; in some cases, even the subjects being
the same, and equally adapted to the simplicity of their
hearers. Several examples of these are given by Hoffman,
in the second part of his Horæe Belgicæe; and I must here
express my thanks to Mr. Thoms, who will, <i>no doubt</i>, convey
them safely to the editor of that very useful publication,
‘Notes and Queries,’ for the kind loan of this book.</p>

<p>There is a story on record, of a terrible plague at Goldsberg,
in 1553, which carried off above 2500 persons, leaving not
more than twenty-five housekeepers alive in the place. The
plague having abated, one of the few survivors went, on
Christmas Eve, to the lower ring, and sang a carol, according
to old custom; he was gradually joined by others, to excite
each other to thanksgiving; and thence arose a custom for
the people to assemble in large numbers, at the upper and
lower ring, on Christmas morning, to sing carols, beginning
with, “Unto us this day a child is born.”</p>

<p>In the time of Henry the Seventh, after the introduction
of the wassail, a good song, that is, no doubt, a carol, was
to be given in answer to the steward’s cry of wassail, by those
belonging to the chapel; and when the king held his state on
other occasions, at Christmas, the carol was introduced. The
reward given to the children of the chapel, for singing “Gloria
in excelsis,” appears to have been usually 40<i>s.</i>; and, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
seventh year of his reign, there is a payment of £1 to Newark,
for making of a song, probably a carol. In the ‘Northumberland
Household Book,’ the reward to the singers varies from
6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> to 20<i>s.</i> On Christmas Day, 1521, the Princess Mary
gave 10<i>s.</i> to John Sentone, and other clerks, of the college of
Windsor, singing before her. William Cornyshe, a musician
of those days, was paid 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> for setting a carol; but scanty
reward, even if he was only arranging any well-known tune;
but the price of a collection was low in proportion, for at
St. Mary-at-Hill, in 1537, Sir Mark had only 3<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> for
‘Carolls for Christmas,’ being five square books. One would
gladly multiply this small fee by a good round figure, to get
hold of these five square books now.</p>

<p>Few of the oldest song tunes had much melody, and there
are probably none extant beyond the fifteenth century; but
here I must again refer to Mr. Chappell’s valuable collection
of English airs.</p>

<p>Church music was cultivated in the sixteenth century, by
clergy and laity, and secular music was also in request. The
pious puritans, both in England and Scotland, used to unite
their rhapsodies to popular song tunes (as has been done in
modern times), frequently preserving a few lines at the commencement.
Luther himself composed some appropriate
hymns of thanksgiving for Christmas.</p>

<p>There are some collections of old carols and songs, with
the music, of the early part of the sixteenth century, or somewhat
earlier, in the British Museum, but not of a popular
description, or of interest, except to the musical antiquary;
and some of the old psalm tunes, as the Bristol, Salisbury, and
Kenchester, have a similarity to the graver style of old carol
tunes. Tusser, who prescribes jolly carols for Christmas,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
mentions one to be sung to the tune of King Solomon.
Several of the existing carol tunes are very pleasing, and are
of considerable antiquity; one or two of them, according to
repute, having been known in Cornwall for three hundred
years and upwards; and some of the northern tunes are,
probably, equally old, though the age may be a little overstated.
The natives of Cornwall have been famous for their
carols from an early date. Scawen says, they had them at
several times, especially at Christmas, which they solemnly
sang, and sometimes used in their churches after prayers, the
burthen of them being “Nowell, nowell, good news, good
news, of the gospel.”</p>

<p>Henry the Eighth, and his children, being skilled in music,
and keeping also the Christmas feast with great magnificence,
carol singing flourished; and Latin hymns being abolished at
the time of the Reformation, the carols became still more in
vogue, and were sung throughout the kingdom. At the grand
Christmasses, at the Inns of Court, the master of the revels
was, after dinner and supper, to sing a carol or song, and
command other gentlemen to sing with him; but it is to be
assumed that he selected such “other gentlemen” as could
respond properly to his call. The Roman Catholics observed
the custom equally with the Reformed church.</p>

<p>
“And carols sing in prayse of Christ, and for to help them heare,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The organs answere every verse with sweete and solemne cheare.”</span><br />
</p>

<p>The carols at this time seem to have been of two descriptions:
one of a serious sort, sung commonly in churches,
and through the streets, and from house to house, as they
were in Shakespeare’s time, ushering in the Christmas morning;
and the other of a more convivial nature, and adapted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
to feasting. The festive carols were sung by the company, or
by itinerant minstrels, that went round for the purpose, to
the houses of the wealthy: some of them were called wassail
songs. Those of the religious or grave style were getting
out of use in private houses, until the time of the puritans,
who, when they began to strive for the mastery, tried to bring
them back, in substitution of the lighter ones, and subsequently
endeavoured to abolish the latter altogether. As
early as 1596, one of them says, that superstition and idolatry
were entertained, which appeared in keeping of festival days,
bonfires, pilgrimages, singing of carols at Yule.</p>

<p>The carol, beginning,</p>

<p>
“All you that are to mirth inclined,”<br />
</p>

<p>was written by the well-known Thomas Deloney, at the end
of the sixteenth century. In the former part of the seventeenth
century, carols continued in great repute, and were
introduced at all the feasts, even those of the higher ranks;
and Bishop Andrews, in a sermon on the Nativity, in 1619,
celebrates it as glorious in all places, as well at home with
carols, as in the church with anthems.</p>

<p>At the celebrated feast of the ‘Christmas Prince,’ at St.
John’s College, Oxford, in 1607, the boar’s head was ushered
in with a peculiar carol, of which there were several connected
with this important dish, and all the company joined in it by
way of chorus. There is an amusing anecdote of carol singers
of this date, in ‘Pasquil’s Jests,’ 1609, which may as well be
given in the words of the original.</p>


<p>“<i>A Tale of a Merry Christmas Carroll, sung by women.</i></p>

<p>“There was sometime an old knight, who being disposed to
make himselfe merry in a Christmas time, sent for many of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
his tenants, and poore neighbors, with their wives, to dinner;
when, having made meat to be set on the table, would suffer
no man to drinke, till he that was master ouer his wife should
sing a carroll, to excuse all the company. Great nicenesse
there was, who should bee the musician, now the cuckow time
was so farre off. Yet, with much adoe, looking one upon
another, after a dry hemme or two, a dreaming companion
drew out as much as hee durst, towards an ill-fashioned ditty.
When, having made an end, to the great comfort of the
beholders, at last it came to the woman’s table, where, likewise,
commandment was given, that there should no drinke
be touched till she that was master ouer her husband had
sung a Christmas carroll; whereupon they fell all to such a
singing, that there was never heard such a catterwalling peece
of musicke; whereat the knight laughed heartely, that it did
him halfe as muche good as a corner of his Christmas pie.”</p>

<p>This jolly old knight might have been a descendant of the
squire of Gamwell Hall, in the time of Robin Hood (who
Mr. Hunter has lately brought down a little from his supposed
aristocratic birth, and cleared from the mist of poetic legend)—for
he is made to say,</p>

<p>
“....Not a man here shall taste my <i>March</i> beer,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Till a Christmas carol he does sing;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Then all clapt their hands, and they shouted and sung,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Till the hall and the parlour did ring.”</span><br />
</p>

<p>Sir Thomas Overbury, who died in 1613, in his description
of a Franklin, says, he kept the “wakefull ketches” on Christmas
Eve, with other observances, yet held them no relics of
popery; other writers of the same age also refer to them. As
the rule of the puritans advanced, and the time of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
Commonwealth approached, endeavours were made, as stated in
a former page, to suppress all observances of Christmas; and
carol singing would naturally share the same fate, and join
therefore in the struggle to avoid absolute destruction. In
‘Festorum Metropolis,’ 1652, it is stated, “As for our songs
and carrols, brethren, they are collected and composed out of
the Scriptures, containe matter of instruction and edification,
they implant the history and benefits of Christ’s birth in the
minds of poor ignorant people; and oftentimes he is taken by
a song that will flye a sermon.” They were still preserved in
private, and in remote places, and old Christmas, in his visit
to Devonshire, before mentioned, names the carols and pleasant
songs as part of the amusements of the evening. Warmstry,
also, in his ‘Vindication of Christmas,’ in answer to an objection,
whether the feast might not be a remnant of the Saturnalia,
and whether the carols might not arise from the hymn
to Ceres, during that feast called [Greek: ioulos], says “<i>Christmasse
Kariles</i>, if they be such as are fit for the time, and of holy
and sober composures, and used with Christian sobriety and
piety, they are not unlawfull, and may be profitable, if they
be sung with grace in the heart.” An observation that may
well be remembered in the present times, in answer to any
objectors.</p>

<p>Warton mentions two celebrated itinerant ballad, and
therefore doubtless carol, singers, about the middle of this
century, called Outroaringe Dick and Wat Wimbars, who
occasionally made 20<i>s.</i> a day, by attending fairs and meetings;
but they must have been of earlier date, as they are mentioned
also in ‘Kind Hart’s Dreame,’ by Henry Chettle, in
1592; their gains, therefore, taking into account the difference
of value in money, were large, and such as would tempt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
many a modern carol-singer, as well as some members of a
recently reformed learned profession, anxiously looking for
any respectable life-boat to save them from sinking.</p>

<p>After the Restoration, the people gladly returned to their
amusements without restraint, and from the reaction, in
many instances perhaps, went into the opposite extreme
and indulged in too much conviviality. Carol singing was
renewed with increased zeal.</p>

<p>
“Carols and not minc’d meat make Christmas pies,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">’Tis mirth, not dishes, sets a table off;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Brutes and phanaticks eat and never laugh.”</span><br />
</p>

<p>It so continued down to the present century, when it
apparently began to abate; but it will be unnecessary to give
any references to prove the continuance of such a custom,
when, to a certain extent, it exists at present, though this and
other observances are much shorn of their honours. Many
of us will recollect when at Christmas time every street of any
note had its carol singers, with their bundle of various carols,
whereas now scarcely one vagrant minstrel can be found
throughout the town, brass bands having blown them out;
but there is still some demand for the carols, and specimens
of broadside carols may be procured from the printers of this
class of literature, in St. Andrew’s Street, Monmouth Court,
Long Lane, and elsewhere.</p>

<p>In Birmingham also, and other large manufacturing towns,
and other neighbourhoods where the practice of carol singing
is retained, popular editions of the style called chap-books,
as well as broadsides may be found; several of them of considerable
antiquity, handed down for many generations, and
frequently illustrated by woodcuts of the most grotesque<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
nature in point of execution and design. Many of us will
also recollect when carols were sung in the country, not only
in the farm-houses, in mansions, and baronial halls, but likewise
in churches—as Heath says, was the custom, in Scilly,
in the middle of last century—and this with much propriety
and right feeling.</p>

<p>
“If unmelodious was the song,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">It was a hearty note and strong.”</span><br />
</p>

<p>Each succeeding year shows a falling-off in the number of
houses where the practice is now admitted; and in many
parts the carols are scarcely heard at all, people getting too
refined, or—too good(?); the extreme west and north, and some
of the manufacturing districts, being the most likely places to
hear them, as they were, in former times, among the yeomanry
of our land. The custom exists also in Ireland and Wales,
there being many carols in the Welch language, some of which
are of ancient date, and others recent; one David Jones, of
Rhuddlan, having died about twenty years since, who for fifty-three
successive years, sang at the church there, a new carol
of his own composing every Christmas; a worthy poet laureat
of his parish.</p>

<p>The practice of singing carols on the Continent is of ancient
date. Crysostom, the unfortunate youth in Don Quixote,
“was such a great man at composing couplets, that he made
carols for Christmas Eve, and plays for the Lord’s Day, which
were represented by the young men in our village; and every
body said they were tip-top.”</p>

<p>The Spaniards, before their country got into so much
confusion, used, in most respectable families, to set up a
<i>nacimiento</i>, which was a rude imitation of rocks, with baby<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
houses, &amp;c., and clay figures, representing the Nativity, the
Shepherds, the ox, and ass, kneeling to the Holy Infant, with
Joseph and Mary in a ruinous stable. They had numerous
collections of carols, and parties used to meet, dancing, reciting
speeches, and singing carols to the sound of the zambomba,
an instrument formed by stretching a piece of parchment,
slightly covered with wax, over the mouth of an earthen jar,
with a slender reed fixed in the centre, from which a sound
was produced something like the tambourine, when rubbed by
the finger. The only refreshments were Christmas cakes,
called <i>oxaldres</i>, and sweet wines, and home-made liquors.</p>

<p>In France, the custom of carol singing was of very early
date, and there are many collections of them, including several
in the <i>patois</i>, or provincial dialect. They are called noël, or
nouel, and sometimes nuel, derived evidently from the same
source, as novell or nowell, used in some of our old carols, and
references to Christmas, as in Chaucer, for instance.</p>

<p>
“Janus sit by the fuyr with double berd,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And drynketh of his bugle horn the wyn;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Biforn him stont the braun of toskid swyn,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And nowel crieth every lusty man.”</span><br />
</p>

<p>The term is, however, sometimes used in the sense of news
or tidings. Some writers have derived it from natalis, as signifying
a cry of joy at Christmas, but this seems a doubtful
etymology. It may have the same origin as yule, or gule, but
it was not absolutely confined to Christmas time, though it was
probably borrowed from its use then. It was frequently used
as a sort of burden to carols. In a carol, or hymn, by Herrade
de Landsberg, Abbess of Hohenbourg, as early as the twelfth
century, saluting the holy “crêche,” or manger, she sings,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">“Leto leta concio</span><br />
Cinoël resonat tripudio,<br />
Cinoël hoc in natalitio,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Cinoël, cinoël,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Noël, noël, noël,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Noël, noël, noël, noël, &amp;c.”</span><br />
</p>

<p>In Normandy it is called nuel. In Burgundy the people
pronounce noé for noël. A priest at Dijon, wishing to avoid
this error, fell into the opposite extreme, and in one of his
discourses repeated three or four times, “l’Arche de noël, et
le patriarche Noé.” The Poitevins write nau; and in la vielle
Bible des noëls, is found “chanter no.” Rabelais talks of
“les beaulx et joyeulx noelz, en langaige poitevin,” and
quotes the two last lines of the following commencement of
one sung in Poitou, within the last twenty years, if not still.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">“An sainct nau,</span><br />
Chanteray sans point m’y feindre,<br />
Je n’en daignerois rien craindre,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Car le jour est ferian,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Nau, nau, nau.”</span><br />
</p>

<p>Many early instances occur of its use as a cry of joy; as at
the baptism of Charles the Sixth, of France, in December,
1368; the entry of Philip, Duke of Burgundy, with his sister,
into Paris, in 1429; and the entry into Paris of Charles the
Seventh, in 1437, where the people proclaimed their delight
with loud shouts of noël.</p>

<p>
“Ce jour vint le Roy à Verneuil,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Où il fut receu à grand joye</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Du peuple joyeux à merveil,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">En criant Noël par la voye.”</span><br />
</p>

<p>On the entry of Henry the Fifth into Rouen, in January,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
1419, though this was about Christmas time, and on his
return to London, he was received with cries of “Nowell!
nowell!” and so afterwards, when the English Regent went
through Paris in state, in 1428, “on crioit haultement nouel!”
and again on the proclamation of Henry the Sixth.</p>

<p>The ancient French customs were in many respects similar
to those of England, having a common origin; and Christmas
was considered, in like manner, a great time for feasting and
rejoicing. In the old poem, of the date of 1400, or thereabouts,
called the “Bataille de Karesme et de charnage,”
Karesme has on his side all the fishes, both sea and fresh-water—being
a decided advocate of temperance—vegetables,
cheese, milk, &amp;c.; Charnage has the animals, birds, &amp;c. The
battle is fierce, and the issue doubtful, when night separates
the combatants; but Karesme, hearing that Noël was approaching,
with considerable succour to his enemy, makes peace on
certain terms, by advice of his council.</p>

<p>The practice of singing carols in France, in the language of
the country, is of very early date, and had its origin, probably,
as early as the time when the people ceased to understand or
to use Latin, the Christmas hymns previously having been in
that language. In “Les crieries de Paris,” of the end of the
thirteenth century, par Guillaume de la Villeneuve, appears,
“Noël, noël, à moult granz cris;” meaning collections of
noëls, of which it is said, that the Duc de la Vallière had a
valuable manuscript collection of the fourteenth century.
The editor of ‘Noël Burguignon,’ in 1720, mentions a volume
that had come to his hands, containing three collections of
old noëls, printed at Paris, in Gothic letters, of which the first
two were without date; the first containing the noël mentioned
by Rabelais; the third was dated 1520, composed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
“<i>feu Maître Lucas le Moigne, en son vivant Curé de S. George
de Pui-la-Garde, au diocese de Poitou.</i>” He also mentions
an old noël in the time of Louis the Twelfth, to the tune of
“<i>A vous point vu la Perronelle?</i>” Brunet gives the title of a
collection printed at Lyon, about 1520, containing one in
the patois of that province, which would appear to be different
from that by Lucas le Moigne.</p>

<p>About 1540, Clement Marot made his celebrated version of
the psalms into French rhyme, which were sung to popular
tunes, and adopted by the French court; and some were probably
introduced at Christmas, as well as the noëls. About
the same time, Calvin introduced the psalms into his congregation
at Geneva, and Sternhold and Hopkins brought
out their version in England, “with apt notes to sing them
withall.”</p>

<p>In the same century was a collection of “Noëls vieux et
nouveaux.” Pasquier, in his work on France, published in
1643, says, “En ma ieunesse c’estoit une coustume que l’on
ausit tournée en cérémonie, de chanter tous les soirs presque
en chaque famille des noüels, qui estoient chansons spirituelles
faites en l’honneur de nostre Seignor. Lesquelles on chante
encores en plusieurs Eglises pendant que l’on célèbre la grand
messe le iour de noüel, lors que le prestre reçoit les offrandes.
Or cette allegresse manifesta encores hors les Eglises; parce
que le peuple n’auoit moyen plus ouvert pour denoter sa ioye,
que de crier en lieu public noüel, quand il vouloit congratuler
à un Prince.” In 1610, appeared ‘Melanges de la musique
de Eustaché du Caurroy, maistre de la musique de la Chappelle
du Roy,’ which contains some noëls, of one of which Burney
has given the music; and it is said that the greater part of
the noëls sung in France are gavots and other airs, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
Du Caurroy composed for Charles the Ninth. The well-known
air, ‘Charmante Gabrielle,’ was also a Christmas
hymn. In ‘Recueil de Poètes Gascons, première partie,
contenant les œuvres de Pierre Goudelin de Toulouse,’ Amsterdam,
1700, are some carols. There are upwards of twenty
different collections in the patois. In 1699, was a collection
by Le Sieur Nicolas Saboly. In 1701, one was published at
Dijon, in the dialect of the province, which at first gave some
offence, from the freedom of the compositions; but the naïveté
of the patois, which also prevented their being perfectly
understood, saved them. There were subsequent editions of
these. In 1720, the fourth edition of ‘Noël Bourgignon de
Gui Barôzai,’ was published, containing thirty-four noëls,
and two chansons, with the music to each, and an ample
glossary; and there was a subsequent edition in 1736. There
is also a recent edition by Fertiault, at Paris, in 1842. Many
of these are written in a vein of burlesque humour, quite out
of character with the subject, and in a very free and irreverent
style. In the seventh noël, the salutation of the Virgin by
the angel, is quite in the manner of a <i>petit maître</i>.</p>

<p>
“Po lai fenétre el antri,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Et peù de queique distance,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Ai li fi lai reverance,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Car el étó bén épri.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Dei vo gar, mai chére aimie,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Dit-i d’ene douce voi, &amp;c.”</span><br />
</p>

<p>The effect of the salutation reminds one of the old lines,</p>

<p>
“Gaude Virgo, Mater Christi,<br />
Quæ per aurem concepisti.”<br />
</p>

<p>and of a similar conceit in Molière’s ‘Ecole des Maris.’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
There is some buffoonery introduced into the fourteenth of
the Coventry plays, as gross as this, but which was adapted
to the rude audiences of its time; and the language of the
buffoons of the piece, Primus and Secundus Detractator, forms
an exception to its general gravity and seriousness. The
fifth noël, amongst other things, introduces the adoration and
offering of the Three Kings, in the following manner.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">“Ai lai Nativitati,</span><br />

</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>The thirteenth is a dialogue between a shepherd and his
wife, and begins in the following quaint way.</p>

<p>
“Fanne, coraige,<br />
Le Diale á mor,<br />
Aipre l’oraige,<br />
J’on le beá jor.”<br />
</p>

<p>The glossary contains, incidentally, some curious particulars.
It is stated to be the custom in the provinces, for the master
of the family, with his wife and children, to sing noëls; “une
très grosse buche,” called <i>lai suche de noei</i>, was put on the
fire, and the younger children were sent into the corner of the
room, to pray that the <i>suche</i> might produce bon-bons; and on
their return, packets of sugar-plums, &amp;c., were found near the
<i>suche</i>, to whom the children implicitly attributed the power of
producing them.</p>

<p>There was a collection of Noëls Bourguignons, by De la
Monnoye, of which a translation into the common language
of the country was published in 1735. De la Monnoye was
denounced by the priests at Dijon, for his carols; but the
translation, though it might have taken off the sting, probably
lessened the humour also.</p>

<p>In 1738 was published, at Troyes, ‘La Grande Bible Renouvelles
de Noëls Nouveaux,’ in four parts, containing ninety
noëls, many of them of a rude and humble description. In
1750, at Avignon, ‘Nouveaux Cantiques Spirituels Provençaux,’
with the music; it contains some noëls, though not
exclusively confined to them. In 1785, at Paris, ‘Noëls
Nouveaux sur les Chants des Noëls anciens, notez pour en
faciliter le chant,’ par M. l’Abbé Pellegrin. In 1791, at
Avignon, Recueil de Noëls Provençaux,’ par le Sieur Peirol,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
Menuisier d’Avignon, nouvelle édition. This contains forty-two
noëls, besides five pieces of a different description. They
are mostly of a light and joyous nature, and the subjects are
very similar to those in our carols. In 1805, there was a
collection of noëls published at St. Malo, and another edition
in 1819, containing twenty-one noëls; and at the commencement
of the work are three pastorals, or dramatic pieces,
in the style of our old mysteries; one on the Birth of our
Saviour; another on the Adoration of the Three Kings; and
the third on the Massacre of the Innocents, where Herod
orders all children under the age of <i>seven</i> to be killed, which
gives his own son, who is one of the sufferers, an opportunity
for making a speech; to this is added the regrets of Herod
for the massacre, in the form of a dialogue between himself
and the Innocents. I have also a collection of “Noëls Vieux
et Nouveaux,” of which the title-page and first two or three
leaves are torn out. In 1807, there was a collection, at
Avignon, of Noëls Provençaux, by Le Sieur Nicolas Saboly,
a new edition, containing ninety. The tunes of some of the
more favourite noëls may occasionally be found in collections
of popular French airs; and among the chap books of the
day are small collections of noëls at small prices, and collections
of Spanish and German carols may be met with.</p>

<p>There are some curious burdens or refrains to some of the
French noëls; one will be seen in the selection given, “Turelurelu,
patapatan;” but these words are intended to represent
the sounds of the flute and tambour. They often introduce
in their old songs “Lurelure,” or something similar; indeed
“Leire la, Leire lanleire,” is very ancient, as also is “Dondon,”
another refrain. “Mironton,” “Biribi,” and “Turlututu,”
are other terms, of which the explanation must be left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
to wordy antiquaries. The English refrains, however, seem
equally as inexplicable as the French; unless we suppose, with
some learned expositor, that the well-known “Down derry
down” has reference to the oak, and is derived from the
Druid, “Hob y deri danno;” but then how are we to account
for “Hey troly loly lo,” and “Dumble dum deary,” &amp;c.? In
the Elizabethan age, “Hey, nonny, nonny” was somewhat a
favourite, though there were some strange burdens also at
this time, that would make us fancy that the celebrated
Tarleton and Kemp must occasionally have improvised any
clinking nonsense that entered their heads, which was afterwards
printed with the songs.</p>

<p class="drop-capi2">SEVERAL of the circumstances referred to in
the carols, may also be found in the early
mysteries, and are probably handed down from
them, or from some legend common to both.
Some, indeed, may have been derived from the
Apocryphal New Testament, as from the birth of Mary, the
Protevangelion, and the infancy. The tradition, for instance, of
Joseph being an old man, is derived from both sources; in the
Coventry Mysteries he complains of his age in many passages.</p>

<p>
“....I am so agyd and so olde,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Yt both my leggys gyn to folde,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I am ny almost lame.”</span><br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>In the cherry-tree carol, and in the Dutch date-tree carol,
he is described as an old man, and weary. This cherry-tree
carol, of which there are two or three varieties, one of which
is printed in the following collection, appears to have been of
the fifteenth century, if not older; as, in Hoffman’s specimens
of Dutch carols of that age, there is one very similar, merely
substituting a date for a cherry tree, the date perhaps having
been considered more oriental. The following is the translation
given in ‘Notes and Queries.’</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">“Joseph he led the ass,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The bridle held he;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">What found they by the way,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">But a date tree?</span><br />
Oh! ass’s foal, thou must stand still,<br />
To gather dates it is our will,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">So weary are we.</span><br />
The date tree bowed to the earth,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To Mary’s knee;</span><br />
Mary would fill her lap<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">From the date tree.</span><br />
Joseph was an old man,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And wearied was he.</span><br />
Mary, let the date tree bide,<br />
We have yet forty miles to ride,<br />
And late it will be.<br />
Let us pray this Blessed Child<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Grant us mercie.”</span><br />
</p>

<p>The tradition is also introduced in the early mysteries, and
the following is the manner in which it is treated in the
fifteenth of the Coventry plays, that may serve as a specimen
of these performances, somewhat quaint and rude to our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
modern ears; and it would puzzle a practised Shakesperian
reader, even a well-skilled relation of my own in this art, to
give one of these ancient dramas with any effect.—Mary says,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">A my swete husbond, wolde ye telle to me</span><br />

</p>

<p>In the French mystery, or Pastoral, as it is called, of the
Naissance, on the first appearance of Joseph and Mary, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
their humble condition, the host resists all the entreaties of
his wife to let them in—she, with the compassion of a
woman (found, as Mungo Park relates, even in the uncivilised
interior of Africa) being moved with the apparent helpless
condition of the Virgin—the surly host, however, says,</p>

<p>
“Fermez, fermez la porte,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Nous ne logerons point des gens de cette sorte.”</span><br />
</p>

<p>Thus repulsed, they then take shelter in the stable.</p>

<p>The legend of the roasted cock coming to life, in proof of
our Saviour’s birth, which is mentioned in the carol of the
‘Carnal and the Crane,’ may also be found in an old carol for
St. Stephen’s Day, of the time of Henry the Sixth; but in
this, instead of crowing three times, as in the more modern
carol, the bird, which in the older version is called a capon,
crows, “Christus natus est.” The legend of the husbandman,
in the same carol, whose seed sprang up before Herod and
his train arrived, has been already referred to, as forming
part of one of the old mysteries.</p>

<p>The curious fancy, in the carol of ‘I saw three ships,’ is
old; one of the ancient Dutch carols given by Hoffman,
beginning</p>

<p>
“There comes a vessel laden,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And on its highest gunwale,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Mary holds the rudder,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The angel steers it on.”</span><br />
</p>

<p>And in an after verse,</p>

<p>
“In one unbroken course<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">There comes that ship to land,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">It brings to us rich gifts,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Forgiveness is sent to us.”</span><br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>Ritson also mentions the following lines, as sung at Christmas
time, about the middle of the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>
“There comes a ship far sailing then,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Saint Michel was the stieres-man;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Saint John sate in the horn.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Our Lord harped, our Lady sang,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And all the bells of heaven they rang,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">On Christ’s Sonday at morn.”</span><br />
</p>

<p>A modern broadside carol, called ‘The Sunny Bank,’ gives
these lines thus.</p>

<p>
“O he did whistle, and she did sing,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And all the bells on earth did ring,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">For joy that our Saviour he was born</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">On Christmas Day in the morning.”</span><br />
</p>

<p>Hone, in his Mysteries, mentions a carol printed by
J. Bradford, Little Britain, 1701, having a large woodcut,
representing the stable at Bethlehem; our Saviour in the
crib, watched by the Virgin and Joseph; shepherds kneeling,
and angels attending; a man playing on the bagpipes; a
woman with a basket of fruit on her head; a sheep bleating,
and an ox lowing on the ground; a raven croaking, and a
crow cawing on the hay-rack; a cock crowing above them;
and angels singing in the sky. The animals and birds have
labels, which are thus explained. The cock croweth, <i>Christus
natus est</i>, Christ is born. The raven asked, <i>Quando?</i>
When? The cow replied, <i>Hac nocte</i>, this night. The ox
cryeth out, <i>Ubi? Ubi?</i> Where? where? The sheep bleated
out, <i>Bethlehem</i>, Bethlehem. Voice from heaven sounded,
<i>Gloria in Excelsis</i>, Glory be on high. There is an old French
mystery of the Nativity, referred to in “Noei Borguignon de
Gui Barôzai,” where four animals are introduced, much in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
the same manner; the ox and ass of the manger, the cock of
the passion, and the lamb of St. John the Baptist. The cock
exclaims, with a piercing voice, <i>Christus natus est</i>. The ox,
with a lengthened bellowing, demands <i>Ubi?</i> pronouncing it
oubi. The lamb answers <i>Bethleem</i>, lengthening the first
syllable; and the ass concludes, with <i>hinhamus, hinhamus</i>,
signifying <i>eamus</i>.</p>

<p>Several carols refer to the crucifixion and resurrection, and,
as formerly observed, are more adapted to Easter than Christmas;
but there are also regular Christmas carols, which carry
our Saviour’s history down to the time of his death. It may
be readily supposed, that the cross itself has a legend attached
to it, and its origin indeed dates from the death of Adam.
When he was at the point of death, he directed his son Seth
to apply to the angel of Paradise, for some of the oil of mercy,
and obtained from him three kernels from an apple of the
tree of life, which he was instructed to plant after Adam’s
death; one in his mouth, and one in each nostril. From the
tree which sprang from these kernels, the rod of Moses, with
which he worked his miracles, was taken, and also the wood
with which he cured the bitter water, and the pole whereon
the brazen serpent was raised. At the time of building
Solomon’s temple, the tree was cut down for use, but it was
in every case found too long or too short, or with some other
defect, and was thrown aside as unserviceable for the temple,
and applied as a foot-bridge; but the Queen of Sheba, during
her visit to King Solomon, refused to pass over it, stating it
would prove the ruin of the Jews. It was then used as a
seat, but the Sybil would not sit on it, predicting that the
Redeemer would die triumphantly on it, for the salvation of
mankind. It afterwards remained in the pool of Bethesda<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
until the time of the crucifixion, when some difficulty arising
in procuring proper wood for the cross, some of the Jews
thought of this tree, which they found perfectly adapted for
the purpose.</p>

<p>One of the versions of the legend states, that a smith being
applied to, to make three nails to fasten our Saviour to the
cross, he refused to do so, and feigned sickness, upon which
his wife came forward and made them. After the crucifixion,
the cross, with its nails, became buried in rubbish, and was
lost sight of, until Helena, the mother of Constantine the
Great, went to Jerusalem, in 326, and after diligent search
found it, together with the crosses of the two thieves, Titus
(the penitent) and Dumachus, the former of whom had prevented
the latter from robbing Joseph and Mary, on their
flight to Egypt, and the child Jesus had then foretold that
they would be crucified with Him, thirty years afterwards,
and that Titus should go to Paradise.</p>

<p>Three crosses having been found by Helena, and the
inscription having been detached, a difficulty arose how to
identify the true one; but this was removed by placing them
by the side of a lady who was dangerously ill, and she was
immediately restored to health on the application of the real
cross. She gave the nails and part of the cross to her
son, and founded a church at Rome, where she placed the
remainder, with the inscription. Constantine, it is said,
placed one of the nails on the bridle of his war-horse, and
one on his sword, and the third was cast into a dangerous
gulf of the sea, to appease a storm.</p>

<p>According to Fabian, Athelstan had in his possession one
of the nails, with part of the cross; and another part with a
nail; and the crown of thorns, were said to have been at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
Nôtre Dame, in Paris; and portions of it claimed to be preserved
in other churches.</p>

<p>There is a curious story on the subject, related in Harl.
MS. 2252 (temp. Hen. 8), entitled, “A grete myracle of a
knyghte, callyde Syr Roger Wallysborow.” Being in the
Holy Land, he wished to bring off privily a piece of the cross,
and praying to that effect, his thigh opened miraculously,
and received it. He then returned to Cornwall, his native
country, having in the course of his voyage, by virtue of the
fragment of the cross, appeased the elements, and prevented
shipwreck. On his arrival, his thigh opened to liberate the
precious relic, of which he gave part to the parish church
where this happened, hence called Cross parish, and the
remainder to St. Buryan, where his lands were.</p>

<p>The slaughter of the Innocents is referred to in several
carols, and there are some written expressly for Innocents’
Day; the day of the week on which it falls being considered
unlucky throughout the year by many. Brand mentions a
custom in Roman Catholic countries of running through all
the rooms of a house, making a pretended search in and
under the beds, in commemoration of Herod’s search for the
children; and there is a tradition that his own son was killed
among them, which made Augustus say, that it was better to
be Herod’s hog than his son, referring to his being a Jew,
and therefore forbidden to kill swine, playing also on the
Greek words, [Greek: un] (un) a hog, and [Greek: uion] (uion) a son. Some
carols, or Christmas songs, refer to the bringing in of the
boar’s head; and in the old carol of St. Stephen’s Day,
before mentioned, St. Stephen, who is stated to be in king
Herod’s service, is, somewhat inconsistently with such service,
introduced as bringing in a boar’s head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>
“Stevyn out of kechon cam w<sup>t</sup> boris hed on honde,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">He saw a sterr was fayr and bryzt ou<sup>r</sup> bedlem stondæ,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">He kyst a down the bors hed and went into the halle,</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Ther is a chyd in bedlem born is bet<sup>r</sup> than we alle.”</span><br />
</p>

<p>It is difficult to say whether the boar’s head was first introduced
at Christmas as a kind of anti-judaical test, because
the Jews would not eat it—something like pork was said to
be eaten at Easter, together with tansy pudding (a corruption
from athanasia);—but as the boar’s head seems to have been
a favourite at all great feasts, at least, from the time of that
greatest of boars, Scrymer, it is probable that it thus became
a “chief service” at the greatest of feasts.</p>

<p>There are several ancient MS. carols in the British Museum,
particularly in Sloane MS. 2593 and Harl. MS. 5396,
Additional MSS. 5465 and 5665 and Cotton MS. Vespasian
A, xxv, of which several, and probably the best, have been
printed in Christmas carols, edited by Mr. Wright, for the
Percy Society, in 1841, and in the collection of Christmas
carols, by the author of the present work, in 1833. There is
also a curious collection of songs and carols, supposed to have
been a minstrel’s book of the fifteenth century, edited, in 1847,
for the Percy Society, by Mr. Wright, whose ability in all
matters connected with the history, customs, and antiquities
of our country, are so well known; old carols may also be
found in the libraries of the Universities. The oldest printed
collection of carols was by Wynkyn de Worde, in 1521, which
contains one on bringing in the boar’s head. Another rare
collection was printed by Richard Kele, in the Poultry,
between 1546 and 1552.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1562, John Tysdale had a license for printing ‘Certayne
goodly carowles to be songe to the glory of God;’ and, in the
same year, Rowlande Hall had one for ‘Crestenmas carroles
auctorysshed by my lorde of London.’ In 1563, John Day
printed some carols of Thomas Becon; and, in 1569, Richard
Jonnes and James Robertes, each printed a collection; the
last being by Christopher Payne. About the same time
Tusser wrote a carol, as well as other poetry, illustrative of
Christmas-tide. In 1579, J. Alder had a license for ‘a Godly
Hymn or Carol for Christmas,’ and in 1580, for ‘Godly Carols,
Hymns, and Spiritual Songs.’ In ‘Songs of Sundry natures,’ by
William Byrd, 1589, there is a Christmas carol which has
been printed by Mr. J. Payne Collier, the distinguished editor
of Shakespeare, in Lyrical Poems, for the Percy Society. In
1597 was published at Edinburgh, ‘Ane Compendioos Booke
of Godly and Spirituall Songs,’ which contains some carols;
these with the other songs were adapted to popular tunes, the
intention being to supersede the use of profaner ballads: it
was reprinted in 1801. In ‘Ancient Scottish Poems,’ Dunbar
has inserted one from the Bannatyne MS. In 1630, ‘Certaine
of David’s Psalmes, intended for Christmas carolls, fitted
to the most common but solempne tunes, everywhere familiarly
used, by William Slatyr,’ was printed by Robert Young, and
a similar work in 1642. There is one also at the end of
Aylett’s ‘Eclogues and Elegies.’ In Herrick’s ‘Noble Numbers,’
1640, there are five carols, or songs in the nature of
carols, some of which were set to music by Henry Lawes, and
were sung before the court, and there are many poems connected
with Christmas customs in his other works.</p>

<p>In 1661 was published a collection called ‘New Carolls for
this Merry Time of Christmas, to sundry pleasant Tunes, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
new Additions, never before printed, to be sung to delight the
Hearers; printed by H. B., for Andrew Kemb.’ In the title-page
was a print of the Wise Men discovering the Star. There
were likewise ‘Christmas carols, fit also to be sung at Easter,’
and ‘New Christmas Carols,’ in 1688. Some of these collections
were encouraged by the puritans, to drive away those of
a lighter description; and, in 1684, ‘A Small Garland of
Pious and Godly Songs,’ of this nature, was printed at Ghent,
for the purpose of superseding the popular ballad, and may be
assumed to have contained serious carols for the same purpose.</p>

<p>We must not omit to mention Milton’s ‘Ode and Hymn
on the Nativity.’</p>

<p>
“It was the winter wild,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">While the heaven-born child,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">All meanly wrapt, in the rude manger lies;”</span><br />
</p>

<p>and single hymns or carols may be found in other writers, to
name which would only be to swell this, already I fear, too
tiresome list. Lewis’s ‘Presbyterian Eloquence,’ 1720, contains
a catalogue of Presbyterian books, in which is the
following: ‘A Cabinet of Choice Jewels; or, the Christian’s
Joy and Gladness: set forth in sundry pleasant new Christmas
carols, viz. a carol for Christmas Day, to the tune of Over
Hills and High Mountains; for Christmas Day, at night, to
the tune of My Life and my Death; for St. Stephen’s Day,
to the tune of O, cruel bloody Tale; for New Year’s Day, to
the tune of Caper and Firk it; for Twelfth Day, to the tune
of O Mother Roger.’ Several of Poor Robin’s Almanacs
contain carols or Christmas poems.</p>

<p>In the broadside and other lists of chap books, ballads, &amp;c.
published about 150 years ago, the names of several well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
known carols occur, as, ‘When Jesus Christ was twelve years
old,’ ‘Joseph an aged man truly,’ ‘Jury came to Jerusalem,’
‘Angel Gabriel,’ ‘Christus natus est,’ &amp;c. There is also a
small collection printed, about the same time, by William
Thackery, at the Angel, in Duck Lane. The carol, ‘Christians
awake, salute the happy morn,’ is said to have been written
by Mr. Greatorex, the father of the late organist, about a
century since, and it is stated that Mr. Webbe, the composer,
set one. The late Mr. Hone, in his work on Mysteries,
1823,—where, as well as in his ‘Every Day Book,’ ‘Year
Book,’ and ‘Table Book,’ much interesting information may
be found relating to Christmas customs—gives a list of eighty-nine
recent carols, and mentions one by Francis Hoffman,
in 1729, with the curious title of ‘<i>A Christmas Carol on
Pekoe Tea</i>’; or, a Sacred Carol, which like tea that is perfectly
good and fine, will be most useful and grateful all the
year round, from Christmas to Christmas, for ever; humbly
addressed to Queen Caroline, and the princess Carolina, and
all the Royal Family.’ Perhaps, if this could be seen, it
might turn out to be a tea-dealer’s puff, for even now with
all our worldly experience, we are occasionally taken in to
read a puff from its innocent and unassuming appearance.
There have been frequent publications of carols, from time to
time, for use, according to the demand, partly in broadsides
and partly in the nature of chap publications, and in a popular
form down to the present time, which need not, and indeed
cannot, be enumerated; and the account given of the old
collected publications is not presumed to be perfect.</p>

<p>In 1822 the late Mr. Davies Gilbert published twelve
favourite western carols, with the tunes, and in 1823 a second
edition, containing twenty, with a few old ballads, &amp;c. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
1833, the author of the present work published a collection of
eighty carols, ancient and modern, with seventeen tunes; and
a copy of the Christmas play of St. George and the Dragon,
with an introduction relating to Christmas customs, the
essential part of which has been embodied in these pages.
Mr. Parker, in 1838, printed sixteen original carols, of a
devout nature, with tunes adapted; and Mr. Chappell introduced
some carols in his collection of National English Airs.</p>

<p>In 1847 Mr. Sharpe published eleven Christmas carols,
with good illustrations; and in the same year, Dr. Rimbault,
a great musical antiquary, edited, in a tasteful form, five
old carols, with six tunes. In 1841, as before mentioned,
Mr. Wright edited a collection of forty-nine old Christmas
carols, for the Percy Society; and in 1847, songs and carols
for the same Society; they are seventy-six in number, of which
about half may be considered carols; there was an illustrated
collection by Mr. Cundell, in 1846, and there are probably
others which have not come to my knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. Hervey, in 1836, published the ‘Book of Christmas,’
containing a good deal of information in a pleasing style, with
illustrations; and two years since a very elegant work was
edited by Mr. H. Vizetelly, called ‘Christmas with the Poets,’
being a selection of poetical pieces, including some carols
from the thirteenth century to the present time, forming an
interesting collection, embellished with fine woodcuts.</p>

<p>Besides the several broadside carols, and printed collections
in town and country, before referred to, there have been
various collections of Welsh carols; several are among the
Myvyrian MSS., belonging to the Cymmrodorion: No. 14,
written about the year 1640, contains thirty-two; and No. 15,
of about the same date, has two. The <i>Lffyr Carolan</i>, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
‘Book of Carols,’ fourth edition, Shrewsbury, 1740, comprises
sixty-six carols for Christmas, and five summer carols; and
<i>Blodeugerdd Cymric</i>, or the ‘Anthology of Wales,’ Shrewsbury,
1779, contains forty-eight Christmas carols, nine summer
carols, three May carols, one winter carol, one nightingale
carol, and a carol to Cupid, which might interest my readers,
if I could translate it.</p>

<p>The carols printed in the following pages, are taken from
a collection of several hundred English, including the broadside
publications for the last thirty years; and French,
including several editions in the <i>patois</i>. Some of the English,
according to reputation, have been known in Cornwall for
nearly three hundred years past, and these, with others, have
been obtained from old manuscript copies now in my possession,
or oral tradition from the singers themselves, and
the tunes have been procured in the same way, though I am
indebted to my friend, Mr. Wm. Chappell, for the harmonies.</p>

<p>I have selected, out of several versions of the western
Christmas play of ‘St. George and the Dragon,’ that which
seemed best adapted for the purpose. Specimens have been
printed in Hone’s ‘Every Day Book,’ the ‘Gentleman’s
Magazine,’ and the ‘Popular Rhymes’ of Mr. Halliwell, who
has applied his store of reading to the illustration of our
poetical literature. There is a version also in that dialect
with some description, in Jan Trenoodle’s ‘Specimens of
Cornish Provincial Dialect,’ a small work for which I am
answerable, and therefore, perhaps, ought not to refer to it,
but I know no other of the sort.</p>

<p>The play of ‘Alexander and the King of Egypt,’ is a representation
of the northern Christmas play, and is taken from
a rare printed copy in my possession. It consists of six pages,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
with very common paper and type, the title-page being,
‘Alexander and the King of Egypt. A mock play, as it is
acted by the mummers every Christmas. Newcastle: Printed
in the year 1788,’ It is given here verbatim, with two or
three slight omissions, necessary for modern ears. The great
similarity between the northern and western plays will
immediately be seen, showing the common origin; but these
performances must be seen to be properly appreciated.</p>

<p>The mummers, in several parts of the country where they do
not go to the extent of acting the old Christmas play, are
generally dressed somewhat in the manner described for
‘St. George and the Dragon,’ one of the party being the
clown or buffoon of the set; and they have some doggrel
lines, of which a few show symptoms of the same antiquity
as the plays; for rhymes, that appear to have been the <i>ad
libitum</i> production of some modern rustic wit, will be introduced,
with “A room! a room! a gallant room!” or some
such line, and the characters are then introduced in the style
of the plays, and this style, as before referred to, is as old as
the Mysteries; take, for example, a specimen from the sixth
of the Chester Plays, where the Nuntius says,—</p>

<p>
“Make rombe, lordinges, and geve us waie,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And lette Octavian come and plaie;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And Syble the Sage, that well fayer maye,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">To tell you of propheseye.”</span><br />
</p>

<p>Two or three specimens of these mummers’ songs are given
by Mr. Dixon, in his ‘Collection of Ballads and Songs of the
Peasantry of England,’ edited for the Percy Society in 1846.
These mummings, as well as the plays and carol singings,
end in an appeal to the box, and right enough too; for, do
not we all, when we have given our services for any purpose,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
carry round the box, in some shape or other, whether the
clergyman for his tithes, the lawyer and physician for their
fees, the soldier for his pay, or the statesman for his salary?</p>

<p>In the selection of Carols, I have tried to vary them in age,
style, and subject, as far as the materials would permit, without
making it too long; and trust that I may, throughout
this work, have succeeded in my endeavour to gratify, and
not to satiate my readers. I have to express my thanks to
Mr. James Stephanoff, for the interest he has taken in the
subjects entrusted to his pencil, and the skill and spirit with
which he has treated them. The design for the binding has
been given by my brother, Mr. Sampson Sandys; and from
the well-known zeal and ability of the publisher and printer,
I am placed in this awkward predicament, that any failure
must rest with myself; and I am fully aware that it can be
no excuse, that the work was undertaken as a relief, from the
pressure of repeated domestic losses of the severest nature:
but I can unaffectedly say, “If I have done well, and as is
fitting the story, it is that which I desired; but, if slenderly
and meanly, it is that which I could attain unto.”</p>

<h2>INDEX TO CAROLS.</h2>


<div class='hang1'>I had hoped to have inserted a Carol by the Rev. R. S. Hawker, of Moorwenstow,
Cornwall, but it was previously engaged for the Christmas number of
‘Household Words.’ I must, however, take the opportunity of correcting
a mistake in ‘Trenoodle’s Specimens of Cornish Dialect,’ where the song of
‘The Trelawney Rising’ is treated as an old ballad. This spirited composition
is the production of Mr. Hawker.</div>

<h2>INDEX OF REFERENCES.</h2>


<div class='hang1'><i>To avoid encumbering the pages with foot-notes, all references requiring them
have been omitted, but the principal works and passages referred to will
be found in this Index, excepting those that already appear in the body
of the work.</i></div>

<p>Many of the old Chronicles have been inspected for historical facts, but it
has not been thought necessary to specify them, except in a few instances;
and where one is cited, the fact is frequently corroborated by two or three
others. Hickes’s ‘Thesaurus,’ vol. i, pp. 209-14, and Gebelin’s ‘Allegories
Orientales,’ contain a good deal of learning about Yule or Gule, and the former
as to midwinter. Du Cange’s ‘Glossary,’ in voce Festum, gives many particulars
respecting the Feasts of Asses and Fools. The Wardrobe Accounts, temp. Edw.
First, have entries connected with that time; and Mr. Collier’s ‘Annals of the
Stage, and History of Dramatic Poetry,’ and the ‘Account of Revels,’ by Mr. Peter
Cunningham, both works containing much valuable information, the Privy
Purse Expenses of Elizabeth of York, of Henry the Eighth, and of the Princess
Mary, the ‘Northumberland Household Book,’ and Nichols’s ‘Progresses of
Queen Elizabeth and King James,’ are the authorities for many of the plays
and masks, and the particulars of the accounts connected with them, and the
New Year’s Gifts from the time of Henry the Seventh to that of James the
First; and many additional particulars may be found in them. Brady’s
‘Clavis Calendaria’ contains much information respecting the early history of
Christmas; and Mosheim’s ‘Ecclesiastical History,’ may also be consulted.
Spelman’s ‘Glossary,’ voce Xenia, and Boulanger, ‘l’Antiquité Devoilée,’ iv, 16,
17, a work however not to be recommended, speak of the ancient New Year’s
Gifts. Madox’s ‘History of the Exchequor’ states the movements of our early<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
monarchs, mentioning for a long series of years where they kept their Christmasses;
and Turner’s, Henry’s, and Lingard’s ‘Histories of England,’ and the
‘Pictorial History,’ may be referred to also, by those wishing to look further
into the subject. Many facts taken from these books do not appear to require
more than this general reference to them.</p>
